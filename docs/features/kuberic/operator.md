# Kuberic: Operator Design

The Kuberic operator acts as SF's Failover Manager on Kubernetes.
It watches `KubericSet` CRDs and orchestrates pod lifecycle, failover,
switchover, and scaling through Kubernetes-backed durable workflows.

## CRD

**`KubericSet`** with:

**Spec fields:**
- `spec.replicas`, `spec.minReplicas`
- `spec.image`, `spec.storage`, `spec.pvcRetentionPolicy`
- `spec.failoverDelay`, `spec.switchoverDelay`
- client, control, and data ports

**Status fields:**
- `epoch`, `currentPrimary`, `targetPrimary`, `phase`
- `reconfigurationPhase`
- optional authoritative `stableSnapshot` with epoch, primary logical ID,
  complete member logical/incarnation identities and roles, write quorum, and
  optional last-known election progress/deactivation metadata
- optional compact versioned `operation` checkpoint for durable creation,
  replica add/rebuild, and failover
- optional `switchoverExecution` reference with immutable switchover admission
  and checkpoint identity; compact history and terminal evidence live in the
  referenced same-namespace ConfigMap
- structured add-replica attempt with frozen primary/target generations,
  endpoints, configuration descriptors, semantic build key, deadlines, and
  commit observation
- optional `removeReplicaExecution` reference with immutable remove admission,
  exact checkpoint identity, contract version, and incompatibility marker;
  compact boundary history, exact prepared commands, and terminal evidence
  live in the referenced same-namespace ConfigMap
- Phase-1 failover/data-loss recovery, including optional
  previous/committed topology, target snapshot, one pending correlated action,
  failover observations/assessment/epoch intents, and optional pod-local
  generation/control-version/runtime-epoch fences and a frozen action payload
- optional `stableElectionMetadataRefresh` checkpoint for topology-scoped,
  write-ahead runtime configuration recording and live progress publication
- `primaryFailingSince`
- per-member stable replica ID and replica incarnation (Kubernetes Pod UID)
- `conditions`

**Reconciliation:** `PartitionDriver` performs read-only stable recovery with
`GrpcReplicaHandle`; Kubernetes-backed state machines own every mutation. A
stable operation is complete only after its resulting snapshot is persisted.
Durable creation persists partial committed bootstrap topology after
primary-only and each expanded current configuration, so process loss rolls
forward from live committed authority instead of replaying `Open(New)`.

Creation, replica add/rebuild, and failover persist their versioned checkpoints
in `status.operation`. Switchover and replica removal instead store immutable
admission and checkpoint identity in `status.switchoverExecution` and
`status.removeReplicaExecution`; their referenced owner-bound ConfigMaps store
compact boundary history, exact prepared commands, and terminal evidence.
Every workflow reconstructs fresh handles and observations on reconcile and
advances one durable transition or one mutating activity at a time. Bounded
read observations may precede either, but a mutation and durable-record patch
never share a reconcile. Pending action intent is durable before RPC,
pod-label, or UID-fenced pod-delete mutation. Status and ConfigMap writes use
Kubernetes `resourceVersion` fencing; no lock is held across a durable
activity.

---

## Reconciler Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Pending` | CRD created, no pods yet |
| `Creating` | Durable initial bootstrap, partial topology commit, and routing publication |
| `Healthy` | Normal operation — monitors health, handles scale, detects failures |
| `FailingOver` | Primary failed, running failover protocol (incl. data loss path) |
| `Switchover` | Planned primary change in progress |
| `AddingReplica` | Durable scale-up or stale-secondary replacement in progress |
| `RemovingReplica` | Durable healthy scale-down or stale/dead-secondary eviction in progress |

Quorum and best-candidate waits are persisted failover sub-phases rather than
top-level CRD phases. `DurableOperation` conditions use
`WaitingForBestCandidate` or `QuorumLoss`. Both wait indefinitely while
missing evidence could change the safe result; elapsed time never promotes a
lesser replica or authorizes data loss.

---

## Healthy Phase Responsibilities

The Healthy phase runs multiple checks on each reconciliation:

```
Healthy phase:
  │
  ├─ 1. Primary health check
  │    Pod ready? gRPC reachable?
  │    → If not: enforce failover delay → FailingOver
  │
  ├─ 2. Durable Phase-1 failover
  │    collect progress/incarnation/epoch/role/config/deactivation
  │    → validate previous/current read quorum
  │    → wait, confirm target, or negotiate data loss
  │
  ├─ 3. Switchover detection
  │    targetPrimary != currentPrimary?
  │    → If yes: → Switchover
  │
  ├─ 4. Secondary health check
  │    Ready replacement incarnation? → durable rebuild
  │    Old incarnation unreachable with retained quorum? → durable force-remove
  │
  ├─ 5. Missing pod detection
  │    driver.replica_ids() vs list_pods()
  │    → If replacement is ready: rebuild; otherwise durable force-remove
  │
  ├─ 6. Scale reconciliation
  │    spec.replicas vs current count
  │    → Scale up: create pods + add_replica
  │    → Scale down: durable configuration-first removal
  │
  ├─ 7. Stable election metadata refresh
  │    topology-scoped correlated config record + exact live progress
  │
  ├─ 8. Node drain detection
  │    Any pod's node unschedulable?
  │    → If primary: switchover to healthy node
  │
  ├─ 9. Multi-primary detection
  │    GetStatus on all replicas
  │    → If multiple primaries: close stale one
  │
  └─ 10. Condition updates
       Set Ready/Degraded/QuorumAvailable conditions
```

## gRPC Failure Tracking

Per-replica `grpc_failure_count` persisted in CRD status. Incremented
on Unavailable/DeadlineExceeded, reset on success. When count reaches
`spec.grpcFailureThreshold` (default 3), treat replica as unreachable
even if pod shows Ready.

### Replica Incarnations

The stable replica ID is derived from the pod ordinal and survives pod
recreation. Each concrete pod uses its Kubernetes UID as
`ReplicaInstanceId`. Runtime status, driver handles, replica-set
configurations, and CRD member status carry that incarnation.

Health reconciliation compares the runtime-reported incarnation with the
handle's expected pod UID. A ready replacement enters coarse add/rebuild,
whose primary coordinator retires the exact old connection before building
the new incarnation. A missing or unreachable old incarnation enters coarse
`Force` removal. In both paths, delayed cleanup for the old
`(ReplicaId, ReplicaInstanceId)` cannot remove a replacement connection.

### ReplicaAgent Dispatch Boundary

Every control request reaches a pod-local `ReplicaAgent` before
`PodRuntime`. The agent owns local admission, correlation, serialization and
bounded completion replay; the runtime owns ordered service/replicator
effects. This is intentionally narrower than Service Fabric RA: the operator
owns distributed workflow progression, CRD status owns stable topology and
operation admission, and the framework-native remove ConfigMap owns remove
boundary history and terminal evidence.

Before a pending runtime action is dispatched, reconciliation requires
replica-agent control protocol version 3 and exact agreement among the
addressed, runtime, and pending Pod incarnations. It persists the observed
agent generation, agent control version, and runtime epoch.
Direct non-add/non-remove actions also freeze their exact encoded payload so
observation and retry signatures cannot drift with live progress. Add/rebuild
uses structured `operation.addIntent` as its payload authority. Removal derives
its structured intent from immutable `status.removeReplicaExecution` admission
and persists the exact prepared command in the referenced ConfigMap.

Missing, malformed, or unsupported agent status fails closed. There is no
capability negotiation or old-peer fallback.

This fence write is a separate reconciliation step and does not consume or
reset the action attempt/deadline budget. The next reconcile reconstructs the
deterministic action and uses `ExecuteCorrelatedControlAction`. A stale
precondition or unavailable-continuity rejection itself executes no effect, so
the advisory fences are cleared and re-observed without consuming an attempt;
the agent makes no claim about whether an older unretained action executed.
Other errors remain counted. The only production mutation call is
`ExecuteCorrelatedControlAction`.

This is a coordinated deployment boundary: quiesce durable topology work and
deploy the operator and replica runtimes together.

---

## Operator Restart Recovery

On the first `Healthy` reconcile after process restart, the operator requires
`status.stableSnapshot`, derives logical IDs from required pod-index labels,
and creates handles from current pod UIDs and addresses. `PartitionDriver::
recover()` calls only `GetStatus`, then requires an exact logical/incarnation
bijection, epoch and stable-role agreement, one primary, complete membership,
and the persisted majority write quorum.

The snapshot is authoritative. `currentPrimary` remains compatibility output
and is refreshed from recovered driver state; it is never recovery input.
Legacy resources without a snapshot fail closed. A missing or inconsistent
stable primary routes directly into durable failover before driver recovery;
non-primary incarnation changes are handled by topology reconciliation or the
phase-specific failover fence. Durable `Creating`, `AddingReplica`, and
`FailingOver` resume from `status.operation`.
`Switchover` resumes from `status.switchoverExecution` and its ConfigMap
checkpoint. A `Switchover` phase without that current native reference fails
closed and never enters the ordinary operation reconciler. `RemovingReplica`
resumes from the production
`status.removeReplicaExecution` reference and its ConfigMap checkpoint.
Completed topology snapshots are refreshed with exact election metadata before
they are used as unavailable-candidate comparison evidence. See
`operator-failure-scenarios.md` §8.

A container restart can keep the Pod UID while resetting role, epoch and all
agent/runtime process-local state. Status exposes a new `AgentGeneration`, so
the new process cannot replay or impersonate the previous process's action.
On restart recovery, a stable secondary with the same Pod UID but unverifiable
runtime role/epoch is persisted into the established durable
force-remove/rebuild path before mutation. A stale primary enters durable
failover. Missing prior-generation local state is never proof that an
ambiguous effect did not run.

## Framework-Native Durable Runner

The operator hosts one bounded in-process runner for production
remove-replica and switchover. It owns authoritative load/reload,
terminal short-circuit, bounded host-outcome fuel, one-use dispatch permits,
fused observation/progression, quarantine, persistence outcome classification,
and deadline-clamped requeues. Its common outcomes are active, terminal,
incompatible, rejected, isolated, conflict reload, unknown-write reload,
persistence failure, and nondeterminism.

Topology policy remains outside the runner. Each adapter independently owns
observation collection, authority and exact-command preparation, effect
dispatch and quarantine interpretation, deadline policy, terminal validation,
and publication/conditions. This boundary is the extension point for a future
add-replica migration; add-replica is not migrated now.

The runner uses the existing kube controller as its scheduler and normal
Set/Pod watches as wakeups. It does not add a worker, queue, lease, watcher,
distributed execution owner, or retry scheduler.

Each framework checkpoint is a same-namespace ConfigMap with a non-controlling,
non-blocking owner reference to the exact `KubericSet` UID. The writer has
`get`, `create`, and `update`, not delete. Active history is replaced by a
compact terminal record, which remains until owner garbage collection or a
separately authorized orphan-cleanup actor applies retention and recovery
policy. Loads and replacements reject a changed owner relationship.

Terminal acceptance alone cannot publish topology. The runner reloads and
validates terminal state through the operation adapter before producing the
publication handoff. A status conflict can therefore retry publication from
the retained terminal without polling replicas or redispatching effects.

## Durable Partition Creation

All initial pods are created with `kuberic.io/role=bootstrap`, which does not
match the primary or secondary client Services. The durable operation first
fences any pre-existing initial serving labels back to `bootstrap`. After every
desired pod is ready, the operator validates pod-index-derived logical IDs and
UIDs, sorts by logical ID, selects the lowest ID as initial primary, and
persists a `CreatePartition` operation before runtime mutation.

The operation explicitly has no previous stable topology. It records the full
target and an optional committed bootstrap snapshot. Primary-only current
configuration is committed and checkpointed first. Each secondary then runs
Open(New), epoch update, idle role, build, active role, catch-up configuration,
write-quorum wait, and current configuration; the expanded partial topology is
persisted before the next secondary starts.

Controller replacement observes runtime postconditions and correlated
activity state. Committed members are never reopened or rebuilt. Failure
before the first commit cleans up and restarts from no topology; later failures
preserve committed members and clean up only the current candidate. Final
routing labels are published one member per reconcile only after the complete
target (and therefore `minReplicas`) is durably committed.

The fencing iterator addresses the exact member at its persisted index, not
the current runtime candidate field. Fence failure never schedules
RemoveReplica, demotion, close, or deletion. Same-incarnation unavailability
fails closed; an uncommitted replacement restarts with a new persisted target
UID while retaining committed members. All compensation phases reject a target
already present in the committed bootstrap snapshot.

## Durable Switchover

The production workflow is a deterministic ordinary-async function that calls
20 operation-specific version-1 typed activities. Its source visibly owns the
normal sequence, sorted replica loops, catch-up waits, pre-promotion restore,
post-promotion compensation, label ordering, topology attestation, and terminal
choice. Production history therefore contains semantic names such as
`kuberic.switchover.revoke-writes`,
`kuberic.switchover.promote-target`, and
`kuberic.switchover.attest-compensated-topology`, not a shared switchover
boundary.

`GetStatus` exposes write access, canonical configuration state,
`current_action`, and bounded `retained_terminal_actions`. Exact-UID Pod labels
provide the corresponding routing observation. Lost replies resume from those
authoritative observations rather than blind RPC repetition. Target-promotion
failure can durably restore the old primary at the advanced epoch; impossible
or stale observations stop or isolate the execution without publishing a new
stable snapshot.

### Framework-native execution

Switchover has one production path. Acceptance first persists
`status.switchoverExecution`, including contract version 4, random execution
ID, deterministic checkpoint name, exact previous topology, distinct target,
operation authority, and acceptance time. No checkpoint or effect exists
before that status write. Contract v4 is a clean break: previous switchover
contract versions and histories are not migrated or resumed. The structural
CRD contains only the current required shape; strict Kubernetes validation
rejects removed, unknown, misspelled, or missing fields.

The direct workflow is the protocol authority. The operation adapter is only
the host boundary: it gathers current replica/Pod observations, validates the
logical activity against immutable admission, prepares the exact correlated
replica or UID-fenced label command, consumes the one-use permit, dispatches,
interprets quarantine, and validates the terminal. The shared runner owns
checkpoint load/reload, bounded-fuel progression, terminal short-circuit, and
persistence outcome classification. Neither the adapter nor runner selects
the next switchover step.

Each named activity also has its own persisted input and output shape. Fixed
old-primary, target-primary, distribution, configuration, and label contracts
contain only fields meaningful to that operation; production does not erase
them into a cross-operation replica/label kind or request superset.

Fused host progression persists a prepared activity directly as
`DispatchExposed`, returning a private permit only after the exact checkpoint
CAS is accepted. An authoritative observation can be persisted together with
the next exposure or terminal state. Replica dispatch freezes exact agent
generation, control version, runtime epoch, correlated action identity, and
payload. Routing-label activities freeze the Pod UID.

An exposed effect is observation-only after restart. A matching terminal
ledger or exact runtime postcondition advances a replica effect; a new agent
generation may instead prove that the command was never admitted, allowing one
redelivery of the same action identity. A second proof stops. Precondition,
unavailable, scheduled, in-progress, mixed, or otherwise unknown evidence
remains quarantined even after the activity deadline. UID-fenced label effects
have no redelivery path and resolve only from the exact UID-bound label
postcondition. ConfigMap conflicts and unknown writes force authoritative
reload before another permit.

The terminal checkpoint is accepted and then reloaded before topology/status
publication. Terminal reload is status-only and does not poll replicas or
dispatch effects. Its immutable branch discriminator distinguishes target
success, revoke-safe failure, previous-configuration restore, and
post-promotion compensation. The adapter accepts only the exact topology and
member-count-specific reachable external/passive accounting pairs for that
branch, including only its available replica redelivery slots. `Completed` and
`CompensatedOrSafeFailure` clear the active
`FrameworkNativeSwitchover` condition and return the resource to `Healthy`;
stopped, incompatible, rejected, isolated, nondeterministic, reload, and
storage states stay visible without publishing an unvalidated topology.

Set and owned-Pod watches remain the primary wakeups. Incomplete effects use
their bounded activity deadline as a safety fallback; storage reloads remain
prompt. One process-local mutex serializes each cached execution. The existing
single operator deployment remains the scheduler and host. There is no
additional worker, queue, lease, watcher, distributed owner, retry scheduler,
service, or provider process.

Checkpoints use same-namespace ConfigMaps with a non-controlling owner
reference to the exact `KubericSet`. The operator has ConfigMap `get`,
`create`, and `update` only. Active and terminal checkpoints live with the
owner and rely on Kubernetes garbage collection after owner deletion.

The contract independently bounds 4,096 workflow-input bytes, 8,192 activity
input bytes, 8,192 activity-result bytes, 33 activity records, 524,288
active-checkpoint bytes, 16,384 terminal-checkpoint bytes, 4,096
terminal-payload bytes, and 512 error bytes. Replay is separately bounded at
64 workflow transitions and each reconcile at 32 runner outcomes. One checked
transition budget covers the normal path, both compensation families,
attestation, and proof-backed redelivery. Externally sourced errors are
UTF-8-truncated before activity persistence, while oversized replayed activity
or terminal errors are rejected.
The declared-maximum fixtures measure 444,601 active bytes and 15,077 terminal
bytes. The nine-member maximum-fault production run measures 64,061 active
bytes and 4,921 terminal bytes while consuming all 33 records. These limits
are switchover-specific and are not copied from remove-replica.

The local mutation boundary remains individually correlated ReplicaAgent
actions. A coarse switchover intent was not introduced because the operation
crosses the old primary, target, retained replicas, and exact-UID Kubernetes
routing objects; the existing per-command identity and observation rules
already provide the required fencing and ambiguity recovery.

The product range remains 1–9 replicas. A one-replica set has no valid
switchover target; valid direct switchover snapshots contain 2–9 members and a
distinct target. Creation, add/build/rejoin, failover, and remove-replica keep
their current execution paths and semantics.

## Scale-Up Reconciliation

When `spec.replicas > current stable member count`:
1. Create new Pod (with ownership labels)
2. Wait for Pod Ready
3. Observe exact primary/target identities, agent generations, control/data
   endpoints, peer version, epoch, quorum, and `minReplicas`
4. Persist one structured add attempt and one coarse pending
   `AddReplicaIntent`
5. Dispatch only to the current primary ReplicaAgent
6. Observe primary coordinator phase, target peer/runtime postconditions, and
   current-configuration commit
7. Label the candidate and publish the target stable snapshot after exact
   attestation

The primary agent owns target Prepare, tracked copy, target Activate, catch-up
configuration, write-quorum wait, current configuration, and compensation.
The operator never sends a production mutation to the add target.
Prepare, Activate, and compensation Cleanup use the internal
`ReplicaLifecyclePeer` v2 service.

The structured attempt is the semantic source of truth. It freezes structural
configuration and derives the target progress from the acknowledged copy LSN.
No per-step add cursor or encoded add action payload is retained.
Copy and quorum wait are tracked asynchronously by `PodRuntime`; status remains
available and exact duplicate copy is suppressed only while target generation
continuity still matches.
Ordinary control effects retain the default 30-second reply bound; a direct
durable `BuildReplica` effect retains the 10-minute copy window used by
unchanged workflows while remaining observable through `GetStatus`.

Stale-secondary replacement uses the same operation after first removing the
old exact `(ReplicaId, ReplicaInstanceId)` connection from the primary. That
retirement is now primary-agent-owned and frozen together with the replacement
identity. The previous stable snapshot remains unchanged until the
replacement's current configuration commits.

Before commit, `Compensated` requires observed previous current configuration
and exact target-connection absence; otherwise status becomes poisoned and the
operator does not delete the target. After commit, recovery is roll-forward
only. If final serving attestation cannot be restored, the operator removes any
target serving label, publishes the proven topology with a
`CommittedDegraded` condition, and lets existing recovery repair it.

---

## Scale-Down Reconciliation

When `spec.replicas` is lower than stable membership, the operator selects the
highest-ID stable secondary. It never removes a primary; switchover must make
that replica a secondary first.

For healthy `ScaleDown`, the operator first requires an exact target
generation, endpoint, and lifecycle-peer v2 observation. If that pre-admission
fails, the set remains `Healthy`, no operation is persisted, and
`ScaleDownTargetUnavailable` is published without repeatedly rewriting
unchanged status. The stale/dead/missing-secondary health paths separately
authorize `Force`.

The operator then:

1. validates `minReplicas` and retained previous-write-quorum safety;
2. persists framework-native remove contract v3 with immutable previous
   topology, exact target incarnation/pod UID/authority, mode, minimum, and
   deadlines; the reduced topology and domain remove operation v2 are derived;
3. records compact passive-observation or exact-command boundaries through the
   shared runner, which grants one dispatch permit only after exact exposure is
   accepted;
4. freezes one generation-qualified `RemoveReplicaIntent` v1 and dispatches it
   only to the exact current primary through correlated control v3;
5. observes bounded primary coordinator evidence until the exact reduced
   Current configuration commits, compensation succeeds, redrive is safe, or
   the operation poisons;
6. persists the primary's exact commit timestamp, configuration signature, and
   the reduced workflow-scoped `committedSnapshot` before global cleanup;
7. fences the old pod's role label to `retired` and deletes only the frozen
   UID through exact prepared boundaries; and
8. persists and reloads the compact terminal before publishing the reduced
   `stableSnapshot`.

There is no remove execution-mode selector or build feature. Legacy pilot and
explicit remove records become durable incompatibility markers and never
authorize a fresh execution. The compact contract limits history to 16
records, boundary inputs/results to 4,096/2,048 bytes, active/terminal records
to 262,144/12,288 bytes, and terminal payloads to 4,096 bytes. The
representative no-fault path is exactly three external effects, two passive
observations, five durable boundaries, and six accepted writes; final
three-sample active records ranged from 3,373 to 18,693 bytes, with a
4,245-byte terminal record and 683-byte terminal payload.

The primary `ReplicaAgent` owns the transient sequence:

```
reduced CatchUp + previous configuration
  → tracked WaitForCatchUpQuorum(Write)
  → reduced Current
  → remove exact old-incarnation connection
  → ReplicaLifecyclePeer Retire
  → final attestation
```

The target agent admits `Retire` only after validating exact sender, parent
action, target incarnation/generation, epoch, committed reduced projection,
and signed expiry. `PodRuntime` performs `ChangeRole(None)` and `Close` in
order. The operator never sends those production removal actions directly to
the target.

Exact reduced Current is the irreversible commit. Before commit, failure may
restore previous Current. After current-install dispatch, rollback requires
positive exact configuration evidence; ambiguous state poisons instead of
guessing. After commit, every path rolls forward and never republishes the
removed member.

`ScaleDown` and `Force` have identical quorum, minimum, commit, connection, and
publication safety. Only target retirement differs: `ScaleDown` starts with
frozen reachable peer authority, while `Force` permits missing authority and
degraded post-commit retirement. Neither mode weakens exact target admission
or quorum.

Primary progress is volatile and bounded. Immutable CRD admission plus the
framework checkpoint are the durable execution authority, and the published
CRD snapshot remains the topology authority. A new primary-agent generation
may receive a new pre-commit attempt only when exact previous Current or
reduced CatchUp survives, up to three attempts.
The three terminal operator dispositions are:

- `FailedPreCommitIncomplete` for a known pre-commit state after deadline or
  attempt exhaustion;
- `InvalidRemovalState` for structurally impossible evidence or ambiguity
  after reduced-current dispatch; and
- `AmbiguousPrimaryRestart` when a complete same-Pod primary restart erases
  all commit-boundary evidence.

All pin the operation in `Poisoned`; their evidence and recovery meaning are
distinct. Post-commit cleanup is not attempt-capped.

**Selection heuristic:** Prefer the secondary with the highest replica ID
(newest). CNPG uses the same approach. SF uses PLB load balancing which
is more sophisticated but unnecessary for our initial implementation.

Removal freezes a 600-second overall deadline, 10-second call bounds,
30-second compensation grace (capped at overall plus 30), and a 60-second
post-commit retirement budget capped by the overall deadline. Status remains
responsive because quorum and peer work is tracked asynchronously. One
reconfiguration runs at a time.
