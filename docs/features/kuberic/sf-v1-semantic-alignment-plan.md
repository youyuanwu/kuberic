# SF V1: Pending Alignment and Qualification

This is a current work queue, not a delivery-phase checklist. Baselines:
Kuberic `e2a47b6c631c974aa0135e81c3a7e3a439980ded`; native SF
`3988b4518236d2d0a37f4d8bdcdf0a2093c5a61d`.
Read [current semantics](classic-v1-runtime.md) first and use the
[disposition ledger](sf-v1-port-ledger.md) to interpret historical SF IDs.
Completing P6 and replacing an old engine do not prove that no core defect remains.

Priorities below order **future separately authorized work**. This
documentation reassessment implements none of it. “Verified difference” means
source-confirmed divergence, not a dynamically reproduced data-loss defect;
“unverified” means missing claim-specific qualification, not demonstrated failure.

## P1 — Verified core alignment differences

### Outer Close outcome

**Current evidence:** the selected production journal executor retains a failed
child result, aborts/cleans up and returns failed outer Close
([program:531–599][close], [diagnostics test:1064–1078][close-test]).
Native outer Close can instead complete Success after aborting a failed child
([native:94–105][native-close-start], [206–275][native-close-end]).
The private native-shaped host is not the selected journal executor.

**Bounded next work:** reconcile selected outer outcome with the chosen native
target without hiding child errors or weakening containment. Include
cancellation, journal replay and retained terminal cleanup; do not substitute
a private-host result for selected public-host behavior.

**Completion criterion:** public-host failed-replicator/failed-application Close
witnesses prove intended outer result, retained child diagnostics, no skipped
containment, no repeated interrupted callback, and actual terminal joins.

### Access during reconfiguration

**Current evidence:** selected production readiness/pending/fence projection
([host:551–576][ready], [692–756][access]) does not select every native
demotion/same-primary read stage
([native:58–144][native-access]). This is a conservative availability
difference, not the stale SF-02 write-bypass finding.

**Bounded next work:** reconcile real selected read/write states across
same-primary reconfiguration, promotion and pre/post-Revoke demotion, preserving
service-local committed visibility and the shared admission/assignment cut
([adapter:421–448][admission], [host Revoke:374–380][revoke]).

**Completion criterion:** actual public-host barriers observe those stages,
including cancellation/replay and final fence release; native-equivalent
policy or any intentional difference is explicit. A private selector pass is
insufficient, and an access grant is never a substitute for service isolation.

## P2 — Focused qualification, not presumed defects

| Obligation | Current evidence / limit | Bounded next work and completion criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **SF-12 rejected-peer event ordering** | Healthy quorum versus hung minority exists ([public:2302–2433][minority]); marked-successor arithmetic exists ([manager tests:690–719][marked]). Neither is both controlled orders of a dispensable remote rejection versus required healthy response. | First establish native fault scope; exercise actual selected owners/public host with both orders. Required healthy evidence must yield the documented outcome regardless of dispensable response ordering, while indispensable-peer/local faults remain distinct. Do not restore the old proof loop or mark Fixed from engine removal. |
| **SF-11 historical trace shape** | Current prefix regression preserves acknowledged prefix before ambiguous suffix ([test:146–214][prefix]); it is not the removed-engine `(11,10)` reconciliation against peer5. | Define a narrowly justified selected-path retained-source/behind-peer case before adding a test. Record what it proves about acknowledged-prefix recovery and what remains outside it; do not claim historical negative controls ran now. |
| **Public copy context** | Distinct nonempty context is actual-component evidence ([test:1013–1091][context]); external public provider uses empty context ([fixture:196–207][empty-context]). | If public nonempty-context qualification is needed, use a helper-free provider with distinguishable target/source bytes including an empty item. Source must consume target data without supplying its own; keep component/public evidence separate. |
| **Mode/fault/interleaving coverage** | Persisted/required-ACK combinations are core-tested ([tests:121–172][modes]); selected production has fixed mode/policy choices ([production:121–158][policy]). | Build a claim-specific component/public matrix and close consequential holes only. Private required-ACK volatile mode is not an exposed public setting; do not expand P7 simply to fill coverage cells. |
| **PG terminal observations** | Orderly stopped progress and retained Abort cleanup have distinct witnesses ([tests:163–249][pg-progress], [940–1050][pg-abort]). | Separately scope any need for SQL racing shutdown, Abort progress snapshots or survivor ranking. Completion requires an actual bounded scenario; existing fsynced files and process cleanup do not establish these claims. |

### P2 — Source-contract wording

Protected Rustdoc still describes catch-up in broader committed/per-configuration
terms ([traits:107–119][catchup-doc]) and epoch callback as “exact durable tail”
([provider trait:53–55][epoch-doc]). Actual selected manager uses captured
`B`/current `Q`/live marked `M` catch-up and issued-tail epoch boundary
([manager:975–1024][catchup], [292–302][epoch]).

**Next work/criterion:** a separately reviewed source-comment-only correction
must agree with pinned native source, preserving every protected method/type
signature. This docs-only workflow does not edit Rust source or infer an unsafe
election defect from stale wording.

## Deployment security qualification

This is not all a rare-extension concern. Production requires HTTP and checks
agent bearer credentials, without TLS
([transport:177–227][http], [728–766][auth]).
Current deployments need an appropriately isolated/protected network, token
handling and namespace/resource controls. No production-security certification
is established by the source checks.

**Bounded next work:** document the intended deployment threat model and
separately qualify network/token/resource controls, or design transport
protection under new authorization. **Completion criterion:** actual deployed
configuration and negative access/credential/network cases support each claimed
protection. Do not imply missing public SF credential-update APIs are accepted
or enforced; they are a different capability obligation below.

## Deferred broad P7 — Still in the original target

The user deferred broad capability expansion **for now**, not because it was
implemented or outside the original alignment target. Existing declarations,
bearer enforcement, basic reporting and private algorithms must not be relabeled
wholly absent.

| Deferred family | Present boundary and remaining original-target obligation |
|---|---|
| Effective settings/defaults/update/retrieval | Address-only public settings and unchanged effective-endpoint update exist ([settings:275–283,390–438][settings]). Full native merge/validation/upgradeability/getter semantics remain ([native Com:490–808][native-settings]). |
| Queue/message/history/Close policies | Fixed production queue/sender/ACK/payload/prewait values exist ([production:40–66][fixed]); native public/internal defaults and settings precedence differ ([native macros:136–207][defaults]). Public configurability is not complete. |
| Persistence, ACK/EOS and operation data | Lifecycle persistence declaration drives selected receiver mode ([production:121–158][policy]); core supports more combinations and a private segmented representation. Public policies/stream-fault/EOS/metadata and lossless buffer exposure still need explicit capability decisions and qualification. |
| Listener/address and credentials | HTTP/bearer carrier exists; native credential-settings/retrieval/update and corresponding peer enforcement are not exposed. TLS absence is an actual deployment constraint, not proof of unauthenticated transport ([native Com:762–808][native-credentials], [transport:728–766][auth]). |
| Scoped fault/health/load/move-cost reporting | Basic partition load/fault methods exist ([partition:1036–1064][partition]); full native scoped reports/batching/clear/convergence behavior is not qualified ([native partition:208–350][native-partition]). |
| Actual interface boundaries | Native exposed interfaces, E_NOTIMPL/internal-only methods, ServiceGroup atomic wrappers and V2 copy-latest are distinct. Do not infer capability from every SDK declaration ([native QI:12–35][qi], [Com:1002–1118][internal]). See [ancestry register](sf-v1-port-provenance.md#native-exposure-and-settings-targets). |

**Re-entry/completion criterion:** when authorized, select a bounded capability,
retain exact source/default/validation semantics and explicit unsupported
outcomes, then demonstrate effective settings, peer enforcement and
closed/invalid-input/failure behavior through the selected public path. Keep
PostgreSQL marked-successor WriteQuorum explicitly unsupported unless separately
implemented; ordinary unmarked WriteQuorum/All and capability-false All fallback
already have current evidence ([PG:1476–1504][pg-wait],
[controller:445–470][fallback]).

## Broader qualification and claim discipline

Native binary/differential execution, exhaustive mode/fault/interleaving coverage,
kernel power-loss durability and production readiness are **unverified**, not
achievements of this rewrite or implications of P6. Real KV/SQLite files,
PostgreSQL processes, component tests and public/controller journeys each have
different scope. [Testing](testing.md) describes reproduction tiers;
[provenance](sf-v1-port-provenance.md) records translated versus source-derived
expectations and exclusions.

Future broad qualification needs an explicit mode/capability/claim matrix,
actual commands/environment/outcomes and bounded success criteria. It must not
become an unprioritized resumption of P1–P8 checkboxes or erase known current core
differences. Documentation consolidation satisfies the present documentation
need, not the entire original P8 alignment claim.
