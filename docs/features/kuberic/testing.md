# Kuberic Test Strategy

Kuberic validation is split into repository-wide nextest tiers, doctests and
explicitly owned Kubernetes scenarios. The removed classic v1 stack has no
remaining test selection.

## Workspace Validation

```bash
just install-nextest
cargo check --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --doc --workspace --all-features
just nextest-test
```

The `ordinary` profile is cluster-free and excludes PostgreSQL, DEX's real
Kubernetes target and build-only guards. It runs with four global slots; the
SQLite group has one slot, and each runtime host process-boundary test reserves
all four slots so its subprocess recovery deadlines are not competing with
another test. CI divides the current ordinary inventory into four slices.

The all-features archive includes every test binary, including resource-backed
tiers. Validate its exact-one disposition and partition union before relying on
it:

```bash
just nextest-archive
just nextest-validate-archive
```

The consolidated validator accounts for 1,260 tests: 1,022 ordinary, one build-only,
205 directly runnable PostgreSQL tests, 12 live KinD scenarios, one DEX live test
and 19 mapped parent-driven subprocess helpers.
Use its generated counts as the inventory evolves.

The ignored runtime `public_api_privacy` binary belongs only to the `build-only`
tier (`just nextest-list build-only`). It invokes Cargo and needs dependency
caches and workspace sources, so CI runs `scripts/check_runtime_public_api.sh`
in the build-artifact job before archiving, never on archive-only runners.
`just nextest-build-only` runs the same guard, and `just nextest-archive`
includes it as a prerequisite. Archive inventory validation still accounts for
the ignored test exactly once.

Internal lifecycle dependency isolation uses stable compiler and Clippy policy
plus a focused ordinary source test:

```bash
cargo test -p kuberic-runtime --test lifecycle_capability_boundaries
```

Rust visibility lints reject unreachable public declarations and private
interface mismatches. Runtime-local Clippy restrictions keep broad runtime and
direct-primary types out of narrow host modules. The source test covers the
remaining Kuberic-specific relationships: aggregate capability traits and
owners, guarded aliases, trait/view escape paths, fixture gating,
construction-only wiring, recursive modules, and the single admitted-build
coordinator. It does not snapshot every private method, field or consumer.
These checks complement behavior suites and the external API/privacy guard;
they do not replace either.

The syntax guard is deliberately bounded rather than a whole-program Rust
analyzer. New explicit Clippy suppressions, macro-generated lifecycle wiring,
block-local capability trait graphs, reverse conversions, and transport child
modules require direct review instead of extending the guard with another
source-language model.

## Level-Triggered Unit and Durable Validation

Use `just nextest-test` for the complete cluster-free tier. For focused
debugging, nextest accepts Cargo package/target selectors in addition to the
repository profile:

```bash
cargo nextest run --profile ordinary -p kuberic-runtime --all-features
cargo nextest run --profile ordinary -p kuberic-controller
```

The runtime `host::tests::crash_boundaries` and `host::tests::recovery` parent
tests execute their ignored child helpers and
reopen durable stores. Top-level ignored process entries are not omitted
coverage.

Controller library tests verify that the checked-in CRD equals the generated
schema. Runtime protocol tests guard representative status growth and reject quadratic
evidence expansion.

The dormant Service Fabric public-operation gate exercises runtime callback
ownership/replay, controller service projection, fault planning and the real
preview child-process boundary:

```bash
KUBERIC_WORKSPACE_TESTS=1 cargo nextest run -j 1 --profile ordinary \
  -p kuberic-runtime --all-features \
  -E 'test(public_operations) or test(public_operation_replay) or test(process_supervisor)'
cargo nextest run -j 1 --profile ordinary \
  -p kuberic-controller --all-features \
  -E 'binary(public_operation_faults) or binary(public_operation_role_address)'
```

The supervisor cases use a true child executable and same data root. They cut
after durable restart acceptance, predecessor containment and successor start;
unproven containment must prevent re-exec. This path remains repository-only
and does not activate preview commands in production controller or gRPC
construction.

## Level-Triggered Live Validation

Live scenarios require Docker, KinD, kubectl, Just, the pinned Rust toolchain,
the pinned nextest binary and `protoc`. The `kind` profile and `kind-live`
group select exactly the 12 ignored live scenarios and use one execution slot.
Use a nondefault cluster, repository-local kubeconfig and exact matching
context:

```bash
export KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=kuberic-level-dev
mkdir -p target/kuberic-level-dev
export KUBECONFIG="$PWD/target/kuberic-level-dev/kubeconfig"
export KUBE_CONTEXT="kind-${KIND_CLUSTER_NAME}"
export KUBERIC_AGENT_BEARER_TOKEN=local-level-triggered-token

just create-kind-cluster
just level-triggered-images
just level-triggered-install
just level-triggered-kind-test bootstrap replacement failover
just level-triggered-kind-test switchover scale-down scale-up
just delete-kind-cluster
```

`all` expands to replacement, quorum-loss, adversarial switchover,
scale-down and scale-up scenarios. Run it on fresh bootstrap; standalone
failover requires another fresh cluster. `scale-up-full` expands to healthy,
multi-add and adversarial scale-up.

On failure, run `just level-triggered-diagnostics` before deleting the owned
cluster. Every mutation and deletion verifies the ownership receipt and exact
context.

The live copy gate is injected only by the owned-cluster installation recipe.
It is absent from the checked-in user sample and is not a supported production
API.

## SQLite V2 Unit and In-Process Validation

SQLite uses actual WAL frames, public stateful application interfaces, durable
agent/application stores and in-process transport. It requires no Kubernetes
API, container runtime or external database process.

```bash
cargo test -p sqlite-replicated \
  --all-features -- --test-threads=1
cargo clippy -p kuberic-runtime -p sqlite-replicated \
  --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

The ordinary nextest tier includes the SQLite example and its private barrier
module's tests under one serial
`sqlite` group, so `just nextest-test` preserves the same resource boundary.

Coverage includes bootstrap, replacement, failover, planned switchover,
sequential scale-up, secondary scale-down, quorum restoration, copy restart and
authority races. Fresh v2 storage is required; no classic data import exists.

See the [SQLite design](../sqlite/design.md).

## PostgreSQL V2 Host-Local Validation

PostgreSQL tests run real local subprocesses with durable stores and
exact-session authority. They require an unprivileged Linux account, pidfds,
subreapers, readable `/proc` and compatible PostgreSQL binaries. PostgreSQL 16
is the validated host major. Missing prerequisites fail rather than skip.
The `just` PostgreSQL recipes detect WSL and skip the tier because its kernel
does not provide the pidfd reaping semantics required by the process supervisor.

```bash
just nextest-postgres-smoke
just nextest-postgres
# Same deterministic four-way hash partition used by an isolated CI runner:
just nextest-postgres 1/4
cargo clippy -p postgres-replicated --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

The smoke target is intended for routine local checks and covers representative
real lifecycle paths. Run the full target only when explicitly requested or in
the dedicated CI validation that owns its resource budget.

The matrix covers physical build/rewind, fencing, failover, switchover,
replacement, scaling, quorum restoration, read-only secondaries and
application/agent restart. The profile has one execution slot. Its complete
207-test inventory is 205 directly partitioned tests plus two ignored
subprocess helpers executed by mapped parent tests. PostgreSQL has no
application-specific KinD test.

See the [PostgreSQL design](../postgres/design.md).

## DEX Validation

DEX default tests are cluster-free:

```bash
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-dex --all-targets
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-dex --doc
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo clippy -p kuberic-dex \
  --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The mocked provider and real API targets are:

```bash
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-dex \
  --features kubernetes --test kubernetes_checkpoint -- --nocapture
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-dex \
  --features kubernetes --test kubernetes_checkpoint_real
```

The real target requires explicit nondefault `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME`,
`KUBECONFIG`, and matching `KUBE_CONTEXT`. It performs access review and owns
its temporary namespace lifecycle. `just nextest-list dex-live` selects exactly
that target. Pull requests run it on the owned smoke cluster; main, version-tag
and CI-manual events run it on a separate receipt-gated cluster.

## Distribution Boundary

No current workflow publishes Kuberic images. Controller/KVStore2 Dockerfiles
and installation recipes are experimental local/CI assets. Existing external
classic images, if present, are unsupported historical artifacts.
