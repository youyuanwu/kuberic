# Kuberic Test Strategy

Kuberic validation is split into exact nextest tiers, workspace checks,
provider-backed smoke tests, and explicitly owned Kubernetes scenarios.

## Workspace Checks

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --doc --workspace --all-features
scripts/check_runtime_public_api.sh
```

The API guard compares documented and source-public inventories and runs an
external privacy fixture. It protects the public interface boundary without
exporting host capabilities.

## Exact Nextest Inventory

```bash
just nextest-validate
```

The current test inventory is:

| Tier | Tests |
|---|---:|
| ordinary | 347 |
| PostgreSQL | 41 |
| KinD live | 3 |
| build-only | 2 |
| DEX live | 1 |
| **total** | **394** |

Ordinary partition counts are `87, 87, 87, 86`. PostgreSQL partition counts
are `11, 13, 8, 9`. The validator proves every test has exactly one tier and
every configured partition union is complete.

## Ordinary Tier

```bash
just nextest-test
```

The ordinary tier is cluster-free. It includes runtime/controller behavior,
real SQLite and KVStore2 providers, immutable old-state rejection, Public V1
wire/history/session/evidence coverage, task reclamation, writer fencing, and
the structural KSF catalog.

Timeout-sensitive hosted recovery tests should use the repository nextest
profile rather than an ad-hoc highly parallel `cargo test` invocation.

## Build-Only Tier

```bash
just nextest-build-only
```

This runs:

- the runtime API/privacy guard;
- the ignored executable Public V1 conformance gate.

The conformance gate executes the registered replacement scenarios under one
bounded parent deadline and checks that every KSF mapping selects an existing
test.

## PostgreSQL

Routine validation:

```bash
just nextest-postgres-smoke
```

The smoke target builds the owned command binary and runs eight representative
Public V1 custom-Replicator scenarios. Run `just nextest-postgres` only when
the full PostgreSQL suite is explicitly required.

## Archive Reproducibility

```bash
just nextest-archive
just nextest-validate-archive
```

The archive is built from the current all-feature workspace after the
build-only gate. Archive validation repeats exact tier and partition
accounting against the packaged binaries.

## Focused Public V1 Coverage

Important focused targets include:

- `kuberic-controller::public_v1_production`: fresh resource bootstrap and
  preseeded-report ordering, exact replacement-incarnation selection,
  contained restart/session renewal, and failover-delay boundaries;
- `kuberic-runtime::public_v1_wire`: protocol-10 rejection and serialized
  `identity` fields;
- `kuberic-runtime::public_v1_conformance`: KSF catalog and ownership
  mutations;
- `kuberic-runtime::public_v1_recovery`: lifecycle, build, failover,
  switchover, containment, task, and writer behavior;
- `kuberic-runtime::public_v1_session_renewal`: durable stage replay,
  participant alignment, monotonic journal supersession, and exact fencing;
- SQLite/KVStore2 `provider_state_rejection`: complete tree/byte immutability
  for old provider state.

## Owned KinD Scenarios

```bash
export KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=kuberic-level-dev
mkdir -p target/kuberic-level-dev
export KUBECONFIG="$PWD/target/kuberic-level-dev/kubeconfig"
export KUBE_CONTEXT="kind-${KIND_CLUSTER_NAME}"
export KUBERIC_AGENT_BEARER_TOKEN=local-level-triggered-token

just create-kind-cluster
just level-triggered-images
just level-triggered-install
just level-triggered-kind-test bootstrap replacement failover
just delete-kind-cluster
```

The harness requires an explicit ownership receipt and refuses default/shared
cluster coordinates. The three scenarios inspect current Public V1 authority,
resources, agent diagnostics, and exactly one granted writer. Bootstrap proves
quorum writes after a contained process restart; replacement proves preserved
data and exact new-incarnation admission; failover uses a sustained containerd
task pause and proves preserved data, post-failover quorum writes, resumed
old-primary fencing, and stale-write rejection. The scenarios do not read
removed legacy status fields.
