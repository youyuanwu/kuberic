# SF V1 Port Provenance and Notices

## Selected upstream and license

The P1 [port ledger](sf-v1-port-ledger.md) and
[test-private expected scenarios](../../../kuberic-runtime/tests/support/sf_v1_vectors.rs),
with selected assertions in
[`sf_v1_foundation.rs`](../../../kuberic-runtime/tests/sf_v1_foundation.rs),
derive from Microsoft Service Fabric at immutable commit
[`3988b4518236d2d0a37f4d8bdcdf0a2093c5a61d`](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric/tree/3988b4518236d2d0a37f4d8bdcdf0a2093c5a61d).
The authorized reference checkout was reviewed read-only and clean at that pin.
No native binary or native test was run. No native production implementation,
transport library or test harness was copied into the runtime.

## Concrete material register

`R/` is `src/prod/src/Reliability/Replication/`. Every scenario's exact
production source path/range is recorded in
[`SCENARIOS`](../../../kuberic-runtime/tests/support/sf_v1_vectors.rs); the
[ledger](sf-v1-port-ledger.md#deterministic-scenario-inventory) supplies immutable
source links. The listed selected native files' copyright headers identify
Microsoft MIT. This register includes translated test material, not just
production algorithm descriptions.

| Material selected / vectors | Exact native test source and case where translated | Transformation / what is not incorporated |
|---|---|---|
| Enqueue/assignment and API error A1 | `R/PublicApi.Test.cpp:454–504`, `BeginReplicateReturnsSOKIfAsyncOperationFails`; production `ReplicationQueueManager.cpp:369–408`, `ReplicaManager.cpp:349–390` | Preserve Begin S_OK / End NotPrimary expected split; chosen numeric progress10/11/full12 from production, not native test constants |
| Gap/contiguous queue Q1 | `R/OperationQueue.Test.cpp:1049–1095`, `TestOutOfOrderOperations1/2` ancestry | Reduce randomized 1024-item permutations to fixed receive2,1 / ACK2,1; no random/Boost fixture copied |
| Memory retention Q2 | `R/OperationQueue.Test.cpp:435–461`, `TestEnqueueOperationsWithMemoryLimit`; production `OperationQueue.cpp:256–318` | Selected 4×100, retained100, reject301/accept100 assertions; production-derived add300 neighbor evicts completed100 and totals600; sufficient count growth, no pending-suffix drop; no C++ queue/harness |
| Commit-before-complete Q3 | `R/OperationQueue.Test.cpp:607–615`, `TestCompleteBeforeCommit` | Selected false/true assertions; empty retained capability100→0 is separate production-derived scenario |
| Secondary trim Q4 | `R/OperationQueue.Test.cpp:867–901`, `TestSecondaryQueueTrim`; duplicate production `OperationQueue.cpp:371–399` | Selected completed-head sequence and count/history limits; no ring/allocator implementation |
| Quorum M1 | `R/ReplicaManager.Test.cpp:154–220`, `TestUpdateConfigurationWithQuorumIgnorePreviousConfig`, `TestUpdateConfigurationNoQuorumIgnorePreviousConfig` | Selected remote progress/configured W and committed/completed values; no sessions/network helper |
| Receive/apply R1 | `R/ReliableOperationSender.Test.cpp:102–143`, `TestReceiveACKProgress` | Retain fixed ACK pair/pending-list assertions and empty timer condition; no native sender/timer implementation |
| Full-copy cancellation C3 | `R/CopyAsyncOperation.Test.cpp:418–449`, `CopyAsync_QueueFull_Cancelled`; production `CopyAsyncOperation.cpp:42–49`, `SecondaryCopyReceiver.cpp:388–395` | Native 15/15/4 and cancel-at12 identified; P1 reduced full/parked/cancel outcome, not complete replay; copy count limits with no maximum-memory limit |
| Demux T1 | `R/ReplicationTransport.Test.cpp:594–617`, `TestDropMessageToNotMatch` | Routing assertions only; remove sockets and Sleep(100); incarnation scenario derived separately from production session lookup |
| Batched health H3 | `R/BatchedHealthReporter.Test.cpp:107–135`, `TestWarningsWithinIntervalReport` | Temp2/latest warning and total2 after Close preserved; timer fire is named input, not sleep or SF report sink |
| Production-derived scenarios M2–M5, S1–S3, R2–R3, C1–C2, C4–C6, T2, D1, L1–L3, E1–E2, H1–H2 | Exact production paths/ranges in each fixture/ledger row: queue/manager, secondary/receiver/stream, session/sender/ACK, copy/establishment, facade/settings, headers, RA lifecycle/access | Small chosen deterministic inputs and expected observations; not wholesale native tests or executed state machines |
| Capability/settings cases | `ComReplicator.h:12–35`; `ComReplicator.cpp:53–83,490–808,1002–1118`; `ComOperationStream.h:12–24`, `.cpp:48–78`; `OperationStream.cpp:66–85`; `reconfig.h:12–17`; `src/prod/src/ServiceModel/reliability/replication/REConfigMacros.h:136–207`; public `FabricTypes.idl:2910–2960` | Classification/default/update facts including legacy flags/EX3 precedence; managed Buffer/Count validation, no attributed Offset bounds check; no COM ABI, credentials implementation or settings parser copied |
| Protected resolved fixtures | Existing Kuberic `application.rs:31–37`, protected traits and external positive/privacy infrastructure | Kuberic-authored compiler identities and trait implementations; no native segmented codec or COM implementation |

### Reviewed-only context, not whole-test translations

- `R/ReplicationSecondary.Test.cpp:529–579,1450–1507,1550–1587`:
  progress/drain mode context, not executed P1 native progress tests.
- `R/ChangeRole.Test.cpp:25–45`: role test registrations, not copied network run.
- `R/ReplicateCopyOperations.Test.cpp:708–741,1093–1105,1455–1467`:
  empty-context and enabled-EOS context, not a translated full copy test.
- `R/ReplicatorSettings.Test.cpp:706–795`: config-store dynamic notifications;
  not evidence that arbitrary public settings updates succeed.
- `src/prod/src/ServiceGroup/Service/ServiceGroup.StatefulService.h:153–180`
  and `ServiceGroup.StatefulServiceUnit.h:27–58`: atomic wrapper boundary only.
- `R/ComProxyStateProvider.cpp:19–26` and
  `src/prod/src/data/txnreplicator/ComStateProvider.h:10–29`: distinct internal
  copy-until-latest marker; no V2 implementation incorporated.
- `R/test/CMakeLists.txt:8–30,37–64`: native dependency/target inspection only;
  no native build configuration or dependencies imported.

## Third-party boundary and future additions

Native
[`ThirdPartyNotices.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric/blob/3988b4518236d2d0a37f4d8bdcdf0a2093c5a61d/ThirdPartyNotices.txt)
is **heterogeneous**, not an all-MIT manifest. For example, its opening entries
include jQuery/Sizzle notices, moby-derived Apache-2.0 code and Boost.Asio under
the Boost Software License. Root MIT alone does not license every vendored file.

The selected Microsoft production/test assertion material above was reviewed
for its own headers/origin. No third-party utility, vendored asset, Boost test
framework, Common/Transport/KTL source or native dependency build graph is
incorporated by P1. Linking of the *upstream* tests to those dependencies does
not mean those sources were translated here. Conversely, a future selection of
such material requires checking its exact origin/license and preserving every
applicable notice. Do not blindly copy all unrelated umbrella notices, omit
applicable notices, or assume an include implies an all-MIT dependency closure.

Every future translated component/test must extend this register with pin,
path/range/case, Rust destination, transformations, retained copyright/license,
third-party selections and actual execution/review status. This is scoped
source/provenance evidence, not an all-distribution legal certification.
