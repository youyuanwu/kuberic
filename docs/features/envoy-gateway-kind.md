# Shared Gateway Access in KinD

The reference deployment routes two independent KVStore applications through
`127.0.0.1:30090`. The gRPC HTTP/2 authority chooses the application:

```text
127.0.0.1:30090 -> Envoy NodePort 30090 -> Gateway listener 8080
                    | kvstore-a.kuberic.test -> kvstore-a-rw:8080
                    | kvstore-b.kuberic.test -> kvstore-b-rw:8080
```

Both application Services remain `ClusterIP`, selecting their own set's
`kuberic.io/role: primary` pods. The operator continues to manage only its normal
application resources. It does not install Envoy, manage routes, or depend on
Gateway implementation-specific APIs. Gateway and route lifecycle belongs to
the deployment owner.

## Pinned Dependencies

The installer uses **Envoy Gateway v1.9.1** and **Gateway API v1.6.1**, a pairing
from the [Envoy Gateway compatibility matrix](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/news/releases/matrix/).
It installs the pinned experimental Gateway API bundle, followed by Envoy's
pinned extension CRDs and controller chart. The controller chart's CRD
installation is disabled to avoid installing a second Gateway API bundle.
The chart selects its matching Envoy Proxy version; the data-plane image is
not independently overridden.

The dedicated CI job uses KinD v0.30.0, Kubernetes v1.34.0 and Helm v3.19.0.
Envoy Gateway and these manifests are reference/test dependencies, not a
production requirement. Production deployments can use a conformant
`GatewayClass` of their choice.

## Run the Reference

Requirements: Linux or a Linux development environment, Docker, KinD, kubectl,
Helm, just, curl, jq, GNU timeout, and the repository Rust/protoc prerequisites.
Port 30090 must be free on the host. This example is plaintext and binds only
to loopback; it does not expose a public authenticated endpoint.

Use a **separate cluster** from the direct KVStore NodePort example. Both
scenarios use NodePort 30090, but only Envoy may own that port in the Gateway
cluster. The installer refuses to take it from a different Service.

From the repository root:

```sh
export KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=kuberic-gateway-dev
export KUBECONFIG="$(mktemp -d)/kubeconfig"
export KUBE_CONTEXT="kind-${KIND_CLUSTER_NAME}"
export KIND_CONFIG=deploy/gateway/kind-config.yaml

just create-kind-cluster
just images
just gateway-install
just gateway-test
```

The existing isolated-cluster ownership checks apply to every Kubernetes
operation. Do not point these commands at a default or production kubeconfig.
The deployment uses a single `Gateway`, an `EnvoyProxy` that customizes the
generated proxy Service's NodePort, and one `GRPCRoute` per application.

The installer waits for the operator, CRDs, controller, GatewayClass and
Gateway. The test additionally waits for accepted/resolved routes, available
proxy pods, the generated NodePort, healthy application sets and the correct
primary EndpointSlices. Route conditions must refer to the resource's current
generation and the exact Gateway namespace/listener; stale or unrelated
`Accepted` conditions do not count as readiness. All waits are bounded:
installation has a 15-minute overall limit, reconnection has a 90-second
deadline, and diagnostic collection has a 180-second overall limit with
5-second Kubernetes requests. Installation and test failures collect GatewayClass, Gateway,
GRPCRoute, EnvoyProxy, Service, EndpointSlice, pod, deployment, event and
KubericSet diagnostics, along with controller, proxy, operator and application logs.

```sh
just gateway-diagnostics
just delete-kind-cluster
```

Deleting the dedicated cluster also removes the pinned CRDs and controller.
It does not affect another application's or another test's cluster.

## Clients Without Hosts-File Changes

The client must dial loopback while sending the appropriate authority. Tonic
uses an endpoint URI for the connection and an explicit origin for HTTP/2:

```rust
let channel = tonic::transport::Endpoint::from_static("http://127.0.0.1:30090")
    .origin("http://kvstore-a.kuberic.test".parse()?)
    .connect()
    .await?;
let client = kvstore::proto::kv_store_client::KvStoreClient::new(channel);
```

For grpcurl, pass the repository proto because KVStore does not require gRPC
server reflection:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext -authority kvstore-a.kuberic.test \
  -import-path examples/kvstore/proto -proto kvstore.proto \
  -d '{"key":"demo","value":"application-a"}' \
  127.0.0.1:30090 kvstore.v1.KvStore/Put

grpcurl -plaintext -authority kvstore-b.kuberic.test \
  -import-path examples/kvstore/proto -proto kvstore.proto \
  -d '{"key":"demo"}' \
  127.0.0.1:30090 kvstore.v1.KvStore/Get
```

The second call must not see the first application's value. Developers may
optionally configure DNS or local aliases, but neither the test nor CI edits
`/etc/hosts`. Unknown authorities have no matching route and cannot reach a
default application backend.

## Primary Transitions and Validation

The Gateway keeps targeting the stable `<set>-rw` Service when the operator
changes primary labels. EndpointSlices move to the promoted pod. Connections
or requests already in flight can fail during this transition; clients should
reconnect and retry appropriate operations rather than expecting the same
transport connection to survive. Retrying arbitrary non-idempotent writes
requires application-level request identity, not a Gateway guarantee.

The test retries connection failures and gRPC `UNAVAILABLE`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`
or `CANCELLED` responses during reconnection. Permanent errors and data-integrity
failures fail immediately; a later success cannot hide incorrect routing or
missing data. Only idempotent test puts are retried.

The separate `gateway` CI job explicitly runs the ignored cluster test. It:

1. Installs the pinned dependencies and both independent three-replica sets.
2. Verifies listener, NodePort ownership, route backend and Service selectors.
3. Writes the same key with different values plus set-specific keys, checking
   data isolation and rejection of unknown authorities.
4. Requests switchover for each application in turn, then deletes each set's
   current primary pod with a required UID precondition to exercise unplanned failover.
   For every transition it exercises the existing connection, waits for a
   different primary and the corresponding endpoints, and verifies fresh
   connections through the unchanged authority and host port.
5. Continuously writes and reads through the other application's route during
   every switchover and failover, then verifies both applications' shared and
   application-specific keys survive and remain isolated.

The normal workspace test suite keeps the direct NodePort test unchanged and
does not install or require Envoy. Cluster-free tests verify authority routing
to a loopback server, exact-parent/current-generation route readiness, transient
retry recovery, permanent/integrity failure handling, and stalled-attempt deadlines:

```sh
cargo test -p kuberic-tests gateway_
```

## Protocol Scope

- `GRPCRoute` routes gRPC traffic by HTTP/2 authority and optionally service or
  method. This is the reference used here.
- `HTTPRoute` is appropriate for HTTP applications and can route by hostname
  and path.
- `TLSRoute` can multiplex TLS connections using SNI where the selected
  Gateway implementation supports it. Configure TLS and certificates according
  to that implementation; this plaintext example does not configure them.
- Arbitrary plaintext TCP carries no standard hostname or SNI. `TCPRoute`
  therefore cannot generally multiplex applications by hostname on one
  listener. Use separate ports/listeners or a protocol-specific handshake.

Direct NodePort/LoadBalancer exposure and a shared Gateway are complementary.
The managed additional-Service feature in issue #55 is not a prerequisite for
this reference: it uses Kuberic's existing internal read/write Services.
