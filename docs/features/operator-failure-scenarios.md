# Kuberic Operator: Failure Scenarios and Recovery

How the operator reconciler detects and handles various failure modes.
Design informed by CNPG patterns (see `docs/background/cloudnative-pg-architecture.md`).

---

## Pod Lifecycle Signals

| Signal | K8s Source | Detection |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Pod missing | Not in `list_pods()` | `driver.replica_ids().len() > pods.len()` |
| Pod not ready | `pod.status.conditions[Ready] == False` | `is_pod_ready(pod) == false` |
| CrashLoopBackOff | `container_status.waiting.reason == "CrashLoopBackOff"` | Specific reason check |
| Pod failed | `pod.status.phase == "Failed"` | Terminal state, won't recover |
| Pod evicted | `pod.status.phase == "Failed"`, `reason == "Evicted"` | Node pressure |
| Pod IP changed | Pod IP differs from GrpcReplicaHandle's address | Pod was recreated |
| Pod pending | `pod.status.phase == "Pending"` | Scheduling, image pull |
| gRPC unreachable | gRPC calls return Unavailable/DeadlineExceeded | `grpc_failure_count >= threshold` |

---

## Requeue Strategy

**Design decision (from CNPG):** Different situations warrant different
requeue intervals. The reconciler should NOT use a single fixed interval.

| Situation | Requeue Interval | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Failover/switchover in progress | 1s | Poll for completion |
| Pod creation/deletion | 1s | Wait for informer cache |
| Secondary not ready (under threshold) | 5s | Give time to recover |
| All replicas unreachable | 10s | Network issue recovery |
| Optimistic lock conflict on CRD | Immediate | Retry with fresh version |
| Normal reconciliation | No explicit requeue | Watches trigger next run |

---

## Cluster Status & Conditions

**Design decision (from CNPG):** Persist enough state in CRD status to
reconstruct the operator's in-memory state after restart.

### CRD Status Fields

Current fields:
- `epoch`, `currentPrimary`, `targetPrimary`, `phase`
- `stableSnapshot`: authoritative stable epoch, primary logical ID, complete
  logical/incarnation member identities and roles, and write quorum

`currentPrimary` and per-member status remain compatibility/observational
output. They are not used to reconstruct topology.

**Implemented and future fields:**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `primaryFailingSince` | `Option<String>` | Persisted Unix time when continuous primary failure began |
| `stableElectionMetadataRefresh` | `Option<Checkpoint>` | Healthy-path configuration/progress refresh cursor and pending action |
| `operation.failover` | `Option<Checkpoint>` | Phase-1 observations, waits, epoch intents, callback result, and attestations |
| `instanceNames` | `Vec<String>` | All instance pod names (for missing-pod detection) |
| `instanceStates` | `HashMap<String, InstanceState>` | Per-instance reported state |
| `grpcFailureCounts` | `HashMap<String, u32>` | Consecutive gRPC failures per replica |
| `conditions` | `Vec<Condition>` | Standard K8s conditions |

### Instance State (per-pod)

```rust
struct InstanceState {
    is_primary: bool,
    current_progress: Lsn,      // last known LSN from ReplicaInfo
    pod_ip: String,             // for stale-IP detection
    last_seen: DateTime,        // last successful gRPC contact
}
```

### K8s Conditions

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `Ready` | Cluster is fully operational (primary + all replicas healthy) |
| `QuorumAvailable` | Write quorum is met (primary + enough replicas) |
| `Degraded` | One or more replicas unhealthy but quorum maintained |

---

## Failure Scenarios

### 1. Primary Pod Crash / Not Ready

**Detection:** Healthy phase checks `is_pod_ready(primary_pod) == false`.

**Current behavior:** ✅ Implemented
- Persists a versioned `Failover` operation before runtime mutation
- Records and validates live incarnation, epoch, role/configuration,
  progress/retained range, health, and deactivation evidence
- Evaluates previous/current read quorum independently
- Persists `WaitingForBestCandidate` or `QuorumLoss` when missing evidence
  could change the safe result
- Durably confirms the deterministic best candidate and immutable target
- Advances configuration/data-loss epochs through separate write-ahead intent
- Invokes epoch-fenced, correlated `OnDataLoss` only after the candidate
  observes the advanced epoch
- Commits promotion, rolls configuration/labels forward, attests exact final
  state, and atomically publishes `Healthy`

**Design addition — failover delay (K8s adaptation):**

SF's FM failovers immediately on heartbeat loss (lease-based federation
detection is fast). On K8s, pod readiness probes can flap during transient
issues. An optional delay prevents unnecessary failovers.

This is a **K8s-specific adaptation**, not an SF pattern. Default should
be 0 (immediate, matching SF behavior). Configurable for environments
with unstable pod readiness.

```
Primary not ready detected:
  │
  ├─ If failoverDelay == 0: immediate failover (SF default)
  │
  ├─ If failoverDelay > 0:
  │    ├─ If primaryFailingSince is None:
  │    │    Set primaryFailingSince = now
  │    │    Requeue after 1s
  │    │
  │    ├─ If elapsed < failoverDelay:
  │    │    Requeue after 1s (keep checking)
  │    │
  │    ├─ If primary recovers:
  │    │    Clear primaryFailingSince
  │    │    Stay in Healthy
  │    │
  │    └─ If elapsed >= failoverDelay:
  │         Clear primaryFailingSince
  │         Transition to FailingOver
```

**Phase-1 quorum and data-loss handling:**

```
Durable failover:
  │
  ├─ Persist full previous/current membership denominators
  ├─ Collect exact-incarnation live evidence
  │
  ├─ Missing replica could outrank survivor:
  │    WaitForBestCandidate; rotate probes; no mutation
  │
  ├─ Previous/current read quorum could still recover:
  │    WaitForReadQuorum; rotate probes; no mutation
  │
  ├─ Read quorum satisfied:
  │    Persist best candidate → configuration epoch → promote/converge
  │
  └─ At least one read quorum conclusively unavailable, no restorer,
       and no possibly better candidate:
       Persist candidate → configuration epoch → data-loss epoch
       Apply epoch → durable OnDataLoss
         NoStateChange → converge compatible target
         StateChanged → refresh candidate → primary-only target
         Error/conflict → poison without promotion
```

Elapsed time never converts missing safety evidence into data loss. This is
deliberately fail closed: the callback path is reached from conclusive
observations, not from a timeout. `failoverDelay` only delays initial primary
failure detection and resets if the primary recovers before operation
persistence.

**Edge case — gRPC unreachable but pod Ready:** See scenario 5.

---

### 2. Secondary Pod Crash / Not Ready

**Detection:** Healthy phase checks ALL replicas for Ready status.

**Current behavior:** ✅ Implemented for stable secondaries. A ready
replacement incarnation uses durable rebuild. An unreachable old incarnation
uses durable force-removal when retained membership can satisfy quorum.

**Implemented flow:**

CNPG detects secondary failures immediately via pod watches and recreates
pods automatically. We should follow the same pattern, but with a grace
period since our pods hold in-memory replicator state.

```
Healthy phase — secondary health check:
  │
  For each secondary in driver.replica_ids():
    Find matching pod in pods list
    │
    ├─ Pod Ready → OK, reset failure tracking
    │
    ├─ Ready pod with new UID:
    │    Persist one AddReplicaIntent to the current primary agent
    │    Primary retires the old exact connection, drives target peer
    │    Prepare/copy/Activate, catches up, and commits current configuration
    │
    └─ Missing/unreachable old UID:
         Validate non-primary target, minReplicas, and retained quorum
         Durable target/previous catch-up configuration
         Wait retained quorum + commit reduced current configuration
         Persist reduced stable snapshot
         Remove exact old primary connection
         Best-effort target demote/close
         Delete old pod with UID precondition
    │
    └─ Pod missing → scenario 3
```

**Impact of not handling:** With persisted-mode ACK (acknowledge-gated
quorum), writes may hang waiting for ACK from a dead secondary. With
3 replicas and quorum=2, one secondary failure doesn't block writes
(primary + 1 secondary = quorum). Two secondaries down → writes hang.

---

### 3. Pod Deleted (Missing from list_pods)

**Detection:** Driver has a handle for a replica ID, but no matching pod
exists in `list_pods()`.

**Current behavior:** ✅ Stable missing secondaries are handled by the same
durable force-removal protocol. Missing primaries still route to failover.

**Implemented flow:**

CNPG detects missing pods by comparing expected instances (from CRD
`instanceNames`) against actual pods. We do the same with `driver.replica_ids()`.

```
Healthy phase — missing pod check:
  │
  Compare stableSnapshot members with current pod logical IDs:
      │
      └─ Stable pod not found:
           ├─ Primary → FailingOver
           └─ Secondary → persist durable Force removal
                target/previous configuration → retained quorum
                → current configuration → reduced stable snapshot
                → exact sender cleanup → UID-fenced pod cleanup
                → later durable scale-up restores desired capacity
```

The operator does not call a monolithic force-remove driver method. It
persists the durable operation first, reconfigures the primary using retained
replicas, and treats target lifecycle calls as conditional after membership
commit.

---

### 4. CrashLoopBackOff

**Detection:** `container_status.state.waiting.reason == "CrashLoopBackOff"`

**Current behavior:** Kubernetes readiness gates primary health. Live gRPC
status checks cover both primary and secondary replicas and drive secondary
staleness handling. The operator does not yet inspect the `CrashLoopBackOff`
reason separately or enforce a recreate-attempt cap.

**Design (informed by CNPG):**

CNPG excludes crash-looping pods from the healthy pool and election
candidates. They cannot be promoted. We should do the same.

```
CrashLoop handling:
  │
  ├─ Crash-looping pods are treated as "not ready" (scenario 2 flow)
  │
  ├─ Primary loss routes to durable Phase-1 failover
  │   Unavailable replicas remain in quorum denominators
  │   Unknown/possibly-best replicas cause an explicit wait
  │
  ├─ After replacementDelay: delete and recreate
  │
  └─ Retry cap:
       Track recreate_count in CRD status per instance
       If recreate_count >= maxRecreateAttempts (default 5):
         Mark instance as Failed
         Log error, set condition Degraded=True
         Don't attempt further replacement
         (app bug requires human intervention)
```

---

### 5. Network Partition (Pod Reachable by Kubelet, Not by Operator)

**Detection:** Pod shows `Ready=True` but gRPC calls from operator timeout.

**Current behavior:** gRPC timeouts surface as errors in reconciler →
controller requeues with backoff. No specific handling.

**Design (SF fencing + K8s-specific detection):**

SF's defense against network partitions is **epoch fencing** — secondaries
reject operations from stale epochs. This is already implemented. K8s adds
complexity because the kubelet and operator have different network views.

#### Level 1: Operator-Side gRPC Failure Tracking (K8s adaptation)

SF's FM uses lease-based heartbeats. On K8s, we use gRPC failure tracking
as an equivalent signal:

```
Per-replica gRPC failure tracking:
  │
  On gRPC error (Unavailable, DeadlineExceeded):
    grpc_failure_count[replica_id] += 1
  │
  On gRPC success:
    grpc_failure_count[replica_id] = 0
  │
  If grpc_failure_count >= grpcFailureThreshold (default 3):
    Treat replica as unreachable
    ├─ Primary → initiate failover (with failover delay if configured)
    └─ Secondary → initiate replacement (with replacement delay)
```

Persist `grpc_failure_count` in CRD status so it survives operator restart.

#### Level 2: Epoch Fencing (SF core mechanism — ✅ implemented)

Our primary defense. When a network partition occurs:
1. Operator detects primary unreachable → failover
2. All secondaries receive `update_epoch(new_epoch)` → reject old primary's ops
3. Old primary's `replicate()` calls fail with quorum errors → `NoWriteQuorum`
4. User code sees `write_status() == NoWriteQuorum` → stops accepting writes

This is the exact SF model. It works even without K8s-specific self-fencing.

#### Level 3: Primary Self-Fencing via Liveness Probe (K8s defense-in-depth)

**This is a K8s-specific addition, not an SF pattern.** SF relies on epoch
fencing + federation heartbeats. On K8s, there's a gap: if the operator
can't reach the primary to send epoch updates, the old primary doesn't
know it's been replaced. The liveness probe fills this gap.

```
Primary liveness probe:
  │
  ├─ Can reach K8s API server?
  │    YES → pass (OK)
  │
  │    NO → Check peer reachability
  │         ├─ Can reach ANY other instance via gRPC data port?
  │         │    YES → pass (OK) — not fully isolated
  │         │
  │         │    NO → FAIL (HTTP 500)
  │         │         Primary is isolated from BOTH API server and all peers
  │         │         → Kubelet restarts pod
  │         │         → Operator detects NotReady → failover
  │
  Replicas: always pass (no benefit to restarting isolated replica)
```

#### Level 4: Multi-Primary Detection

After partition heals, operator may see two pods reporting as primary.
Epoch comparison resolves this deterministically:

```
Multi-primary detection (Healthy phase):
  │
  GetStatus on all replicas
  If multiple report as primary:
    ├─ The one with the OLDER epoch is stale
    ├─ Call close() on the stale primary
    ├─ Delete and recreate the pod
    └─ add_replica to rejoin as secondary
```

---

### 6. Node Failure / Node Drain

**Detection:** Multiple pods become NotReady simultaneously, or node is
marked `Unschedulable`.

**Current behavior:** Primary failure detected → failover. Secondary
failures ignored.

**Design (from CNPG):**

#### Node Drain Handling

CNPG detects drain taints and proactively moves the primary off draining
nodes. We should add a similar mechanism:

```
Healthy phase — node drain detection:
  │
  For each pod:
    Get pod's node
    If node.spec.unschedulable == true or drain taint present:
      ├─ If pod is primary:
      │    Find secondary on a schedulable node
      │    Trigger switchover to that secondary
      │
      └─ If pod is secondary:
           Mark for replacement after drain completes
           (PDB protects against too-fast eviction)
```

#### Pod Anti-Affinity (Prevention)

Add to CRD spec and pod template generation:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinityType: preferred  # or "required"
```

The operator generates anti-affinity rules:

```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:  # or required
    - weight: 100
      podAffinityTerm:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kuberic.io/set: {set_name}
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

**Default: `preferred`** — pods spread across nodes when possible but
can colocate if scheduling fails. `required` enforces strict separation
(may prevent scheduling if not enough nodes).

---

### 7. Quorum Loss (Majority of Replicas Down)

**Detection:** Primary's `write_status()` returns `NoWriteQuorum`, or
gRPC calls to majority of replicas fail.

**Current behavior:** Primary-dead Phase-1 quorum loss is implemented in the
durable failover operation. Primary-alive `NoWriteQuorum` condition reporting
remains future operator health work.

SF distinguishes **quorum loss** (runtime state: writes blocked, system
waits) from **data loss** (explicit FM decision: committed ops may be
irrecoverable). Kuberic does not infer data loss from elapsed time.

See `docs/background/service-fabric/failover.md` §Quorum Loss
and Data Loss for the full SF protocol.

#### Case 1: Primary alive, write quorum lost

The runtime reports `NoWriteQuorum` and blocks writes. Operator conditions and
an explicit primary-alive recovery policy remain future work; the operator does
not automatically advance the data-loss epoch from a timer.

#### Case 2: Primary dead, quorum lost (data loss scenario)

Covered by the failover protocol (§1). The operator evaluates previous/current
**read** quorum from exact live observations. It waits while any unavailable
member could restore quorum or outrank the surviving candidate. Once all
safety-relevant members are accounted for, it persists the data-loss epoch,
applies it to the candidate, and invokes correlated `OnDataLoss`.

#### Case 3: Quorum loss during reconfiguration

The pure evaluator and persisted failover schema support distinct previous and
current configurations and count overlap independently. Production handoff
currently starts from stable `Healthy` topology, so previous configuration is
absent. Mid-reconfiguration failover handoff remains future work.

**Key principle:** Missing evidence is a wait, not permission to discard it.
Data loss requires conclusive observations and a durably confirmed candidate.

**Prevention (matching SF):**
- Use `spec.minReplicas` ≥ 2 to require quorum for writes
- Use pod anti-affinity across nodes (fault domain spreading)
- Synchronous replication (our default via persisted-mode ACK)
- Monitor `WaitingForBestCandidate` and `QuorumLoss` durable conditions

---

### 8. Operator Crash / Restart

**Detection:** N/A — the operator itself restarts.

**Current behavior:** ✅ Stable `Healthy`, durable `Creating`, durable
`Switchover`, durable replica add/rebuild, and durable replica removal recovery
are implemented. CRD snapshots/checkpoints survive in etcd while current pod
metadata and runtime status attest the live topology and pending activity.

```
Operator restart — first reconcile per KubericSet:
  │
  ├─ Require status.stableSnapshot:
  │    stable epoch, primary ID, complete members/roles, write quorum
  │
  ├─ List pods with label kuberic.io/set={name}:
  │    For each pod:
  │      Derive logical ID from the required pod-index label
  │      Create GrpcReplicaHandle from current pod UID and addresses
  │
  ├─ PartitionDriver::recover(snapshot, handles):
  │    Call only GetStatus
  │    Validate logical/incarnation bijection, exact epoch and stable roles
  │    Validate one primary, complete membership, and majority write quorum
  │    Rebuild handles and current configuration without runtime mutation
  │
  ├─ Validate consistency:
  │    Any absent/duplicate/relabelled/reincarnated member → fail closed
  │    Any runtime epoch/role/incarnation mismatch → fail closed
  │    Runtime unhealthy but otherwise consistent → recover, then health logic
  │
  └─ Resume normal reconciliation
```

`GetStatus` requires replica-agent control protocol version 2, add/build peer
protocol version 1, and reports a pod-local
`AgentGeneration`. It is distinct from the Pod UID and changes when the
container/process restarts in place. Missing, malformed, or unsupported agent
status fails closed. A new generation publishes no inherited correlated action
state. Pending dispatches are fenced to the observed generation and agent
control version; an old-generation request is rejected without effects. If stable secondary
role/epoch continuity cannot be reconstructed under the same Pod UID, the
operator persists the established durable force-remove/rebuild operation
before mutation. Missing old-generation state is never treated as proof that
an ambiguous activity did not run.

`currentPrimary` is refreshed from recovered driver state and is not trusted
as input. Legacy status without `stableSnapshot` is rejected. Stable topology
changes persist a fresh snapshot; multi-member add/remove loops patch after
each committed change. If runtime mutation succeeds but status persistence
does not, the live operator retries that exact pending status before another
action.

During `Creating`, `Switchover`, `AddingReplica`, `RemovingReplica`, and
`FailingOver`,
`status.operation` is the authoritative compact checkpoint. Creation records
explicit no previous topology and an optional committed bootstrap snapshot;
the other protocols record previous/target stable snapshots. Each operation
stores exact target incarnations, current phase, and one write-ahead correlated
action. Add/rebuild additionally stores one structured frozen intent with
primary/target generations and endpoints, configuration descriptors, semantic
build key, deadlines, and commit evidence. Each reconcile reconstructs fresh handles, observes
role/epoch/incarnation/progress/write/configuration/activity state, and either
advances one checkpoint, dispatches one activity, waits, compensates, or
poisons. The operator sends only AddReplicaIntent to the primary; peer/runtime
phases are transient. Add/rebuild observes coarse phase and tracked copy,
restores previous current configuration before pre-commit cleanup when needed,
and requires connection absence before deleting the candidate. A target process
restart under the same Pod UID changes generation and invalidates prior build
proof. Current-configuration commit is roll-forward only; unattested committed
membership becomes `CommittedDegraded` without a serving label. Kubernetes
`resourceVersion` rejects stale concurrent advancement. Failover
additionally persists Phase-1 observations, unavailable-probe rotation,
separate configuration/data-loss epoch intents, callback result, promotion
commit, and final attestations.

Creation commits primary-only and expanded partial bootstrap snapshots before
starting later members. Pods remain on a non-serving bootstrap label until the
complete target satisfies `minReplicas`; routing publication is itself
checkpointed. Before the first commit, cleanup can restart from no topology.
After a commit, creation preserves committed members and retries only the
candidate. A changed committed-member incarnation fails closed.

**Boundary:** Stable failover from `Healthy`, including data loss, is
recoverable. Mid-reconfiguration handoff into failover and loss of an
uncommitted bootstrap primary remain separate recovery problems.

---

### 9. Stale/Zombie Primary (Split Brain)

**Detection:** After failover, the old primary pod may still be running
and accepting writes if it didn't receive the epoch fence.

**Defense layers (SF core + K8s additions):**

| Layer | Mechanism | Origin | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1. Epoch fencing | Candidate observes the new epoch before promotion; retained secondaries receive it during post-promotion convergence. | **SF core** | ✅ Implemented |
| 2. Role status | `set_status_for_role()` sets `NotPrimary` on demotion. `StateReplicatorHandle::replicate()` rejects. | **SF core** | ✅ Implemented |
| 3. Primary self-fencing | Liveness probe isolation check (see scenario 5, level 3). Pod self-kills if isolated. | **K8s addition** (from CNPG) | ❌ Not implemented |
| 4. Old primary routing fence | Durable label convergence removes the old primary from serving selection; physical cleanup follows topology reconciliation. | **K8s addition** | ✅ Label fence |
| 5. Multi-primary detection | Healthy phase detects two primaries via GetStatus. Closes stale one (epoch comparison). | **K8s addition** | ❌ Not implemented |

**SF's primary defense is epoch fencing (layers 1-2).** Layers 3-5 are
K8s-specific additions that cover gaps where the operator can't reach pods
to deliver epoch updates. SF doesn't need these because the federation
subsystem provides reliable failure detection via lease-based heartbeats.

**Layer 4 — old primary cleanup:**

```
After failover completes:
  │
  ├─ If old primary pod still exists:
  │    Try close() on old primary handle
  │    If gRPC fails (unreachable):
  │      Delete the pod (force kill)
  │    Create replacement pod
  │    add_replica as secondary
  │
  └─ If old primary pod missing:
       Already gone, create replacement if needed
```

**SF-aligned failover:** The operator validates previous/current read quorum
and the complete best-candidate ordering. Missing quorum-restoring or possibly
better evidence remains in an explicit durable wait. Once observations
conclusively establish data loss, the operator advances the data-loss epoch
before correlated `OnDataLoss`; it never promotes merely because time elapsed.

**New in Healthy phase:**
- Secondary health monitoring (replace unhealthy replicas)
- Missing pod detection (replace deleted pods)
- Node drain detection (switchover off draining nodes)
- gRPC failure tracking (detect unreachable but "Ready" pods)
- Multi-primary detection (close stale primary)
