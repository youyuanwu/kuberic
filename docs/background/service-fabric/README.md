# Service Fabric Stateful Service Architecture

A detailed study of how Azure Service Fabric achieves high availability and
failover for stateful services — covering the system architecture, the
replicator protocol, reconfiguration phases, and the Rust API surface from
[service-fabric-rs](https://github.com/Azure/service-fabric-rs).

Source code reference: `build/service-fabric/` (depth-1 clone).
