# Kuberic Durable Execution Kernel

`kuberic-durable-execution` is a focused kernel for deterministic, linear
workflow replay. It has no dependency on `kuberic-core` or
`kuberic-operator`; the operator uses it for production framework-native
remove-replica and switchover workflows. It is not an end-user runtime.

## Selected authoring surface

The feasibility evaluation selected an ordinary async surface. A typed
activity declares its input, output, immutable versioned identity, and encoded
bounds once through `DurableActivity`. Workflow bodies use
`WorkflowContext::call::<A>(input).await`; activity names, exact byte wrappers,
JSON calls, and result bounds stay out of the workflow body. Workflow and
store futures are `Send` so a host turn can run directly inside an asynchronous
controller without a second executor.

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use kuberic_durable_execution::{
    DurableActivity, ExactBytes, TerminalOutcome, Workflow, WorkflowContext,
};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct GreetingInput {
    name: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
enum GreetingResult {
    Greeted(String),
    Rejected { code: u16 },
}

struct Greet;

impl DurableActivity for Greet {
    type Input = GreetingInput;
    type Output = GreetingResult;
    const NAME: &'static str = "greeting";
    const VERSION: u32 = 1;
    const MAX_INPUT_BYTES: u64 = 1024;
    const MAX_RESULT_BYTES: u64 = 4096;
}
```

Inside `Workflow::run`, an ordinary call is:

```rust
let result = context
    .call::<Greet>(GreetingInput {
        name: "Ada".to_owned(),
    })
    .await;
```

`ActivityCallError` reports deterministic identity, encoding, decoding, and
bound failures in a portable bounded form. Domain rejection or failure belongs
in the declared output enum, as shown above, and is stored through the same
completed-result lifecycle as success. The low-level
`WorkflowContext::activity(ActivitySpec)` API remains available for justified
advanced and compatibility uses. No explicit poll/replay authoring surface is
exported.

For direct-style workflows, each meaningful operation boundary can be a
separate `DurableActivity` and the ordinary async workflow body can express
ordering, loops, waits, terminal choices, and compensation directly. An
effect-specific `PreparedActivityResolver` may replace a logical typed input
with an exact prepared command before exposure, while preserving the declared
name, version, and result bound. The kernel still owns only deterministic
replay and persistence safety; the caller's adapter owns domain observations,
command preparation, dispatch, quarantine interpretation, deadlines, and
terminal validation.

## Replay and checkpoint semantics

Typed calls first canonicalize JSON object-key order, then compare the encoded
input exactly on every replay. Low-level `ExactBytes` are compared without
normalization and encoded as validated base64 JSON strings. Workflow history
is a contiguous, zero-based sequence with a completed prefix and at most one
final pending activity. A requested activity must match the recorded sequence,
immutable positive-versioned name, exact input, and declared result bound; a
mismatch is nondeterminism rather than a new dispatch.

Format version 3 stores JSON payload bytes in a versioned
`CheckpointEnvelope`. An immutable `ExecutionSpec` declares execution
identity, exact workflow input, and the maximum exact-byte terminal payload.
The persisted execution contract also records the active and terminal
encoded-checkpoint capacities under which the execution was admitted. Every
load validates that authority and rejects either changed limit before workflow
polling.

The payload has exactly one explicit lifecycle state:

- `Active` contains the complete bounded linear history, with records in
  `Scheduled`, `DispatchExposed`, or `Completed` state.
- `Terminal` contains `Succeeded` or `Failed` exact bytes and the completed
  activity count. It has no activity history or digest.

Unsupported and prior formats are compatibility errors, not storage
conflicts. While active, completed activity results replay into workflow code
without a dispatch permit. Once terminal, a turn returns the stored outcome
and observed revision directly without polling workflow code.

Logical activity identity is the complete tuple of execution ID, sequence,
versioned activity name, exact activity input, and declared maximum result
bytes. Its external rendering contains the complete tuple without hashing or
normalization. `AttemptId` is a separate host-epoch and monotonic-counter
identity, so a discarded pre-exposure attempt may change without changing the
logical activity.

## Checkpoint limits and result reservation

Every `DurableHost` requires `CheckpointLimits` for maximum activity records,
maximum canonical active-checkpoint bytes, and maximum canonical
terminal-checkpoint bytes. Exact configured boundaries are accepted; loaded or
proposed checkpoints beyond the applicable lifecycle boundary are rejected
before workflow progress or publication.

Before an absent execution is evaluated, the host projects both success and
failure terminal checkpoints at the execution's declared maximum payload and
a maximum-width completed activity count. The projection uses checked
base64/JSON length arithmetic without allocating the declared payload. The
larger form must fit the configured terminal encoded limit. The active and
terminal capacities are persisted as immutable admission authority. Capacity
failure therefore precedes even the first schedule and every possible
external-effect permit. Later hosts must use the same admitted limits; changing either lifecycle limit
for a versioned operation without a contract-version change is incompatible.

Before committing dispatch exposure, the host projects the completed
checkpoint containing a result at exactly the activity's declared maximum.
The projection calculates base64 and JSON lengths without allocating that
maximum result. If it cannot fit, exposure is rejected and no permit exists.
An observation larger than the declaration is rejected without mutation. This
ensures that a permitted activity result within its declaration cannot later
fail solely because its completed checkpoint lacks capacity.

## Storage revisions

`CheckpointStore` exposes runtime-neutral asynchronous `load` and
`compare_and_swap` operations. `load` distinguishes an absent checkpoint from
a portable classified `StoreError`; errors preserve a provider description
without exposing provider-specific types. `StorageRevision` is a validated
nonempty opaque string token with equality semantics and is unrelated to
checkpoint format version. It exposes no numeric, ordering, or increment API.

CAS returns only `Accepted`, `Conflict`, or `OutcomeUnknown`. A provider must
classify any result whose acceptance cannot be proven as `OutcomeUnknown`;
`StoreError` is reserved for definitely local or pre-request failures. A
conflict or unknown outcome returns `ReloadRequired`, while a provider error
returns `StoreFailed`. None grants dispatch permission. The included
`InMemoryCheckpointStore` keeps its numeric revision counter private, renders
opaque tokens, and can return the same unknown result with or without applying
the mutation.

## Kubernetes checkpoint provider spike

The default-off `kubernetes` feature adds `KubernetesCheckpointStore`. A caller
supplies a `kube::Client` and a namespace, retaining ownership of credential
discovery, the async runtime, namespace lifecycle, retries, and all workflow
effects:

```rust,no_run
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use kuberic_durable_execution::KubernetesCheckpointStore;

let client = kube::Client::try_default().await?;
let store = KubernetesCheckpointStore::new(client, "durable-checkpoints")?;
# let _ = store;
# Ok(())
# }
```

`KubernetesCheckpointStore::new` uses independently retained checkpoints and a
786,432-byte ConfigMap data budget. Advanced callers can use
`KubernetesCheckpointStore::with_options` with
`KubernetesCheckpointStoreOptions` to select a budget from 1 through 983,040
bytes and optionally attach one `KubernetesCheckpointOwner`. The owner wraps a
Kubernetes `OwnerReference` plus either a namespaced or cluster-scoped
assertion. A namespaced owner must name the checkpoint namespace. Required
identity fields and the immutable UID must be nonempty, and controlling or
deletion-blocking references are rejected before any request. The provider
does not fetch the owner, so the caller remains responsible for the accuracy
of its scope, GVK, name, and UID. Before a replacement, the provider reads the
current object and rejects a stale revision or owner relationship that differs
from the store configuration, so reconstruction cannot silently change a
checkpoint between independent and owner-based retention.

Each execution maps to
`kuberic-checkpoint-<32-lowercase-execution-id-hex>` in that namespace. The
format-3 envelope's canonical JSON is stored in
`data["checkpoint.json"]`; the object is labeled
`kuberic.io/component=durable-checkpoint`. Initial CAS uses create-if-absent.
Successor CAS uses replace with the caller's exact, opaque
`metadata.resourceVersion`. Already-existing creates, stale replacements, and
replacements racing with deletion return the portable unit `Conflict`; the
host's next load obtains authoritative state.

Explicit API rejections map to portable `StoreError` kinds and diagnostics
retain only the operation plus API code/reason. Mutation transport failures,
5xx responses, and successful responses without a usable revision are
`OutcomeUnknown`, because acceptance cannot be disproved. The provider never
embeds Kubernetes error types, credentials, checkpoint contents, or arbitrary
transport text in its public errors.

The data budget is the aggregate UTF-8 byte length of every ConfigMap `data`
key and value. An exact-bound object passes this local gate; one byte over is
rejected before dispatch. This provider check is separate from and does not
weaken the kernel's activity-count and encoded-checkpoint limits. Passing the
budget does not guarantee API-server acceptance: metadata, managed fields,
annotations, owner references, admission mutation, and API-server policy can
consume capacity or reject the object independently.

Checkpoints have no provider-driven terminal deletion. Terminalization
CAS-replaces active history with a terminal record and retains the ConfigMap.
Without an owner reference, the checkpoint remains independently retained
until an explicitly authorized lifecycle actor removes it. With an owner,
ordinary Kubernetes garbage collection may remove the checkpoint after that
owner is deleted. Orphan selection, retention policy, and recovery-safety
checks remain responsibilities of a separate lifecycle actor, not this
provider.

The namespace-scoped
[writer RBAC example](deploy/checkpoint-writer-rbac.yaml) grants only ConfigMap
`get`, `create`, and `update`. The separate
[cleanup RBAC example](deploy/checkpoint-cleanup-rbac.yaml) grants only
ConfigMap `list` and `delete`; it is optional and intentionally not granted to
the writer identity. These examples do not alter or broaden the existing
operator permissions.

`store.metrics().snapshot()` reports only writes confirmed by a response with a
usable authoritative revision. It includes accepted-write count, canonical
checkpoint JSON bytes, canonical typed server-returned ConfigMap JSON bytes,
and measurement failures. Object bytes include server metadata and are not raw
HTTP-wire bytes. The validation watch measurement similarly canonicalizes each
delivered typed `WatchEvent<ConfigMap>` and excludes HTTP framing and transport
overhead.

## Turns and dispatch permission

Awaiting `DurableHost::turn` evaluates and commits no more than one persistence
boundary:

1. For an activity-bearing workflow, the first turn accepts a `Scheduled`
   checkpoint and returns no permit.
2. A later turn prepares an attempt, accepts a separate `DispatchExposed`
   checkpoint revision, and only then returns an opaque `DispatchPermit`.
3. After observations make active replay complete, the host CAS-replaces the
   full active checkpoint with a minimal terminal checkpoint.
4. `WorkflowCompleted` is returned only after that CAS is accepted or a later
   load observes terminal state. It carries the exact success/failure outcome
   and accepted/observed opaque revision.

A zero-activity workflow skips schedule, exposure, and observation. Its first
turn validates terminal capacity and CAS-creates terminal state directly from
absence before returning `WorkflowCompleted`.

Construction requires the checkpoint store, caller-supplied host epoch, and
validated `CheckpointLimits`; callers supply the executor used to await turns
and observations.

The permit is evidence that this in-process host observed acceptance of both
persistence boundaries. It is **not** proof of exactly-once execution: a crash
may occur after exposure persistence and before, during, or after the external
effect.

### Internal prepared exposure

Effect-specific adapters may pass a `PreparedActivityResolver` to
`turn_and_expose_with` and `observe_and_turn_with`. For a new logical request,
the resolver supplies the complete bounded `ActivitySpec` before checkpoint
encoding, result-capacity reservation, and the exposure CAS. For replay, it
validates the complete recorded specification against the logical request;
the kernel then performs its normal exact specification comparison. Derivation,
validation, encoding, or bound failure occurs before persistence and produces
no permit.

The accepted `DispatchExposed` checkpoint is therefore the authority for the
exact command. A permit is created only after that checkpoint CAS is accepted
and identifies the same logical activity and attempt. Conflict, definite store
failure, and `OutcomeUnknown` never produce a permit. If an unknown outcome was
applied, reload sees the complete exposed specification as quarantined; if it
was not applied, reload sees the predecessor. An unresolved exposure remains
quarantined until the host receives authoritative completion or
effect-specific proof that permits a safe retry. Process-local knowledge that
a permit or reply was lost cannot override checkpoint state.

This is an internal, opt-in host/evaluation behavior. The public typed
authoring contract is unchanged: existing `DurableActivity` declarations,
`WorkflowContext::call`, immutable name/version identity, canonical typed
input/output encoding, exact replay matching, and declared input/result bounds
continue to use identity preparation by default.

Completion conflict or `OutcomeUnknown` returns `ReloadRequired` and never a
permit or completion. If an unknown write applied, reload observes terminal
state. If it did not apply, reload replays completed active results and retries
terminalization without redispatch. Provider failures return `StoreFailed`;
every later attempt starts with a fresh load.

Callers with effect-specific authoritative recovery can opt into the fused
host methods without changing the low-level behavior above:

- `turn_and_expose` evaluates the next activity, reserves its maximum result,
  and persists it directly as `DispatchExposed` in one CAS. It creates the
  opaque permit only after that CAS is accepted.
- `observe_and_turn` validates one exact authoritative observation, replays
  deterministic workflow code, and uses one CAS to persist either the
  completed result plus the next `DispatchExposed` command or the compact
  terminal state.

Conflict, definite store failure, and `OutcomeUnknown` at either fused boundary
never return a permit. An unknown-after-apply next exposure reloads as
quarantined, including the case where this process knows it never received the
permit; generic recovery does not weaken that conservative rule. The original
`turn` and `observe` methods remain the default for arbitrary effects.

Terminal success and failure payloads share the `ExecutionSpec` bound. An
exact-bound outcome is accepted. A larger outcome is an explicit checkpoint
contract violation and is not persisted or reported complete. This workflow
failure outcome does not add activity-failure behavior.

## Quarantine and observation recovery

Reloading an unresolved `DispatchExposed` activity returns `Quarantined` with
the persisted logical and attempt identities before workflow-definition
matching. Quarantine does not redispatch, compensate, mutate the checkpoint,
or schedule a later activity. After an authoritative observation resolves the
exposed activity, ordinary replay resumes and still reports any definition
mismatch as nondeterminism before a later dispatch.

The host leaves effect execution to its caller. A caller may later supply an
authoritative `ActivityObservation` for the exact exposed logical activity.
An accepted observation records the exact result, after which normal replay
continues. Missing, stale, or mismatched observations are rejected; competing
observations use the same CAS rule. The crate does not determine the
observation's trust source or transport.

## Validation

Run the bounded feasibility evidence and the complete crate/workspace gates:

```console
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-durable-execution --test feasibility -- --nocapture
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-durable-execution --all-targets
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-durable-execution --doc
cargo fmt --all -- --check
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo check --workspace
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo clippy -p kuberic-durable-execution --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The standalone kernel exposes the Kubernetes provider behind its
`kubernetes` feature. The production operator enables that feature
unconditionally because framework-native remove-replica requires ConfigMap
checkpoints; the explicit feature flag below is only for crate-local provider
validation:

```console
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-durable-execution --features kubernetes --test kubernetes_checkpoint -- --nocapture
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-durable-execution --features kubernetes --all-targets
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo clippy -p kuberic-durable-execution --features kubernetes --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

A feature-gated test performs authorization preflight, creates a temporary
namespace, validates the provider against the configured real Kubernetes API,
prints its measurement report, and waits for namespace deletion:

```console
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p kuberic-durable-execution --features kubernetes --test kubernetes_checkpoint_real
```

The repository's existing [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/CI.yml) enables
all crate features on its workspace-wide test command after
`helm/kind-action` has provisioned a uniquely named, one-control-plane KinD
environment with a dedicated kubeconfig/context, dynamic loopback port, and
ownership receipt. There is no second provider cluster or cleanup owner.
Ordinary local and default Cargo test runs without the Kubernetes feature do not select this test.

The test reports a failed endpoint or authorization precondition rather than
claiming real-API coverage. Its apply-then-unknown and no-apply-unknown cases
mask the store result around real persisted state; they validate host recovery,
not reproduction of an actual network fault.

The feasibility test reruns the sole conformance registry, emits every
assertion, measures the FR-012 surface, and applies the exhaustive FR-014
three-way classifier. The revised evidence contains 45 unique contiguous
scenarios and 135 structured assertions; all pass. All five FR-012 authoring
predicates and all five provider, bounding, lifecycle, and documentation
predicates also pass. The async runtime-neutrality predicate examines the
library `[dependencies]` table rather than test-only dependencies and retains a
negative fixture for a real library runtime dependency. The mechanically
derived result is **feasible** within this kernel's stated boundary.

## Production operator consumers

Framework-native remove-replica and direct-style switchover are production
consumers of the shared operator runner. Both use the same load/reload,
single-use permit, fused progression, quarantine, terminal compaction, and
ConfigMap provider mechanisms, but each adapter retains its own contract,
activity/result shapes, limits, observations, effects, deadlines, terminal
validation, and publication rules.

Remove-replica's compact contract version 3 stores immutable admission once
and records tagged passive observations, exact prepared
replica/label/delete commands, compact results, and bounded redelivery
evidence. Legacy pilot and explicit remove records, unsupported versions, and
changed lifecycle limits are incompatible rather than migrated or restarted.

`status.removeReplicaExecution` owns the immutable execution reference,
admission authority, and incompatibility marker. The referenced same-namespace
ConfigMap owns active boundary history and the compact terminal record. Other
explicit operator workflows continue to use their operation-specific CRD
status checkpoints.

The no-fault three-member path is exactly three external effects, two passive
observations, five completed durable boundaries, and six accepted writes. The
final three-sample run observed active records from 3,373 to 18,693 bytes, a
4,245-byte terminal record, and a 683-byte terminal payload. These are
run-specific measurements; the representative active gate is 49,152 bytes.
The immutable lifecycle limits are 16 records, 4,096-byte inputs, 2,048-byte
results, 262,144 active encoded bytes, 12,288 terminal encoded bytes, and a
4,096-byte terminal payload.

The runner reloads terminal state before the remove adapter can hand it to
topology publication. Same-namespace checkpoint ConfigMaps use a
non-controlling, non-blocking `KubericSet` owner reference, remain through
terminal reload, and are deleted with the owner by Kubernetes garbage
collection. Independently retained orphan cleanup remains a separately
authorized lifecycle responsibility. No worker, queue, lease, watcher, or
separate execution service is introduced.

Direct-style switchover uses 20 operation-specific version-1 typed activities.
Its workflow source, rather than the kernel or host adapter, visibly owns the
normal and compensating sequence. The adapter resolves logical calls to exact
prepared `ReplicaAgent` or UID-fenced label commands before exposure and
supplies authoritative observations afterward. This demonstrates the reusable
direct authoring pattern without adding an activity registry, generic
compensation engine, or distributed runtime.

## Deferred usability roadmap

The crate intentionally stops at the durable-execution kernel.
Completion-only compaction and an isolated Kubernetes checkpoint-provider spike
are implemented. Production framework-native remove-replica and switchover
adopt the kernel through a shared in-process operator runner without
moving effect ownership into it. Generic active-history compaction and
continuation remain excluded. The remaining ordered deferred work is tracked in
[Durable Execution Framework Roadmap](../docs/features/kuberic/durable-execution-roadmap.md).

## Limitations and exclusions

The kernel remains experimental as a general-purpose orchestration framework.
The ConfigMap provider is production-required, not opt-in, for
framework-native remove-replica and switchover: `kuberic-operator` enables it unconditionally
and owns the provider contract described above. The earlier isolated real-API
evaluation does not establish generic persistence fitness for other consumers,
distributed execution ownership, a worker, queue, lease, activity
handler, automatic observation polling, or passive-observation transport. The
kernel does not establish a canonical exact-byte representation across
versions.

The classifier is recomputed from the current registry rather than assuming a
positive result. Provider cases distinguish absence from every portable error
class, exercise opaque revisions, and make applied and unapplied unknown CAS
outcomes indistinguishable to the host. The lost-effect-reply fixture still
invokes one synthetic effect under an opaque permit and discards its returned
result before restart.

Generic activity handlers/registries, a second activity-failure lifecycle,
passive convergence, tracing/inspection, timers, retries, parallelism, generic
lifecycle APIs, queries, external events, child workflows, workers, queues,
leases, and distributed runtime ownership are excluded. So are migrations,
upgrade guarantees, broad rollout of other operations, and production
diagnostics. Framework-native remove-replica integrates typed calls and
operator-owned effect adapters through its existing compact workflow;
switchover is the direct-style named-activity reference. Neither changes
`ReplicaAgent` or the gRPC protocol.
