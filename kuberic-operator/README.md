# kuberic-operator

Kubernetes operator for [Kuberic](../README.md). Manages `KubericSet` custom resources — creates pods, orchestrates lifecycle, and handles failover.

## What It Does

1. Watches `KubericSet` CRDs (desired replica count, image, ports)
2. Creates/deletes bare pods to match desired state
3. Persists durable topology intent and delegates ordered effects through each
   pod's `ReplicaAgent`
4. Detects pod failures and triggers automatic failover
5. Sends one coarse scale-up/rebuild or scale-down/force-remove intent to the
   primary agent while retaining durable topology and Kubernetes ownership

## Production Remove Replica

Remove-replica always uses the framework-native durable workflow; there is no
remove execution-mode selector or remove-specific build feature. The
operator's shared in-process runner persists compact exact-command and
observation boundaries, quarantines uncertain exposed effects, and reloads
conflict or unknown-write outcomes before another one-use dispatch permit can
exist. Existing correlated control v3, `RemoveReplicaIntent` v1, and
`ReplicaLifecyclePeer` v2 behavior is unchanged.

The current three-member no-fault path records three external effects, two
passive observations, five durable boundaries, and six accepted writes.
Terminal checkpoint state is accepted and reloaded before reduced topology is
published.

`status.removeReplicaExecution` stores immutable admission, checkpoint
identity, and incompatibility state. The referenced same-namespace ConfigMap
stores compact boundary history and terminal evidence with a non-controlling
owner reference to the exact `KubericSet` UID. It remains through terminal
reload and is garbage collected with the owner; separately authorized orphan
cleanup is not granted to the normal writer. Reconciliation remains the
scheduler, so there is no extra worker, queue, lease, watcher, or durable
service.

## CRD Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kuberic.io/v1
kind: KubericSet
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: my-app:latest
  controlPort: 50051
  dataPort: 50052
  clientPort: 50053
```

## Framework-Native Switchover

Switchover always uses the framework-native durable workflow. There is no
execution-mode selector or optional operator build feature. The workflow
stores format-3 checkpoints in same-namespace ConfigMaps named
`kuberic-checkpoint-<execution-id>`. They have a non-controlling owner
reference to the `KubericSet`, remain through terminal reload, and are garbage
collected with that owner. The operator needs ConfigMap `get`, `create`, and
`update`; it does not need checkpoint delete permission. Reconciliation
remains the scheduler and all replica mutations continue through
`ReplicaAgent`.

The workflow uses typed activity calls and compact effect/observation
records. Deterministic switchover transitions replay in memory; fused
checkpoint CAS operations durably expose an exact command before returning a
permit and combine authoritative observation with the next command or terminal
state. Unknown replica or UID-fenced label outcomes remain quarantined and are
not automatically retried. Set/Pod watches provide normal wakeups, with
bounded deadline requeues as a fallback.

Use `status.switchoverExecution` and the `FrameworkNativeSwitchover` condition
to inspect immutable admission, checkpoint identity, current-contract
validation, storage reloads, exposed/quarantined work, and completion.
Resources in the `Switchover` phase without a current native reference fail
closed and are not restarted automatically.
Creation, add/build, removal, and failover retain their existing execution
models.

The representative integration test reports checkpoint, status, effect,
label, and Pod-list measurements. The canonical three-member path is nine
external effects, three passive observations, 12 durable boundaries, and 13
accepted writes.
